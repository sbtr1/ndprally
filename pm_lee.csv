"Good evening again. My fellow Singaporeans, we have had an eventful year. We have been busy guarding against terrorism and strengthening our racial harmony, making friends and cooperating with other countries big and small.",2017
"Last year, I spoke about our economy: how we were working to develop skills, build capabilities, promote entrepreneurship, and take the economy to the next level and I am happy to report good progress.¾We expect growth around 2.5 per cent this year, higher than last year. Wages have been rising, gradually but steadily, and most encouragingly, productivity is improving. Last year, productivity went up by one per cent, after several years of almost zero growth. This year, we should do even better. This is important because productivity is the key to our prosperity, and to higher wages.",2017
"We still have work to do.¾Heng Swee Keat and the Future Economy Council are hard at it. Unions and employers are fully on board. And together, we are implementing Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), industry by industry. We are also pressing on with SkillsFuture, preparing everyone for the jobs of the future, helping workers and professionals with the problems of today when they are displaced from their jobs, retraining and reskilling them to take up new jobs. If we can keep up this path, we can create better jobs and new opportunities for our workers and businesses.",2017
"The immediate priorities are important and we will continue to focus on them but tonight I want to take a step back from these immediate priorities. Instead, I would like to discuss three longer term issues that are important to the success and wellbeing of Singapore, for the current generation and also for future generations.",2017
"One, building up our preschools so that every child, regardless of his family background, starts well and has a bright future. Two, fighting diabetes, because many Singaporeans suffer from it, not only the old, but increasingly younger people too, and three, making Singapore a Smart Nation, by using IT to the full, to create jobs and opportunities for all Singaporeans.",2017
"Preschool, Diabetes, and Smart Nation _ these are the things we must do now, work on now, to build our future so that Singaporeans can start right, stay healthy and live smart at every age.",2017
"Let me start with preschool. Here, we are talking about infants to six year olds. Nowadays even two month old babies are enrolled in infant care, and that is part of preschool.Preschool is important to give our children a good start and the best chance to succeed in life. In the past, we started at Primary 1, when the child is seven. But now we know we have to begin much earlier, not to give children a head-start in Primary 1, but to build sound foundations for them for life. At an early age, there are specific windows in a childês development and you must catch that window or you miss it.",2017
"For example,¾a child picks up language skills most easily and rapidly in his first three years. You miss that and it becomes much harder later on. In fact, it is best if they hear the language sounds as infants, before they are eight months old. Social and emotional skills need to be learnt early too: how to play with other children, how to be patient and wait your turn, how to behave when you do not get what you want.",2017
"Cognitively, young children need stimulation. Parents and teachers need to encourage kids to talk, not to tell them to keep quiet. Kids are naturally curious. Encourage them to wonder about the world around them, to ask questions, to explore, to express themselves. Of course, parents and family members are the first and best teachers for children, because they look after them, play with them, and talk to them most intensively. But a good preschool will help parents to make the most of these formative windows of a childês development.",2017
"Preschool is also a great practical help to working couples because nowadays, both parents are likely to be working. Not all grandparents are available to become babysitters! They like to play with their grandchildren; they do not want to be responsible for their grandchildren.",2017
"Hence,¾five years ago, the Government moved decisively, to build up preschools, and transform the whole sector. We created almost 50,000 more childcare and kindergarten places, especially in young estates like Punggol and Sengkang. We increased subsidies to make preschools more affordable. We raised the standards of Anchor Operators.¾PCF Kindergartens have become Sparkletots, with better curriculum, and better trained teachers. NTUCês My First Skool has also developed engaging programmes. Last month, I visited My First Skoolês campus in Punggol, built on top of a multi-storey carpark. It has an arts programme, coordinated by the National Arts Council. Artists visit the kindergarten to work with the kids and the kids were enjoying all sorts of art _ painting, making things, doodling with coloured chalk on a blackboard. I joined them, some of them were doing better than me because I did not do art when I was in kindergarten.",2017
"The Ministry of Education (MOE) has also started to run MOE Kindergartens, for children of ages five and six. They have developed a good curriculum. They have hired well-trained teachers, including mother tongue teachers _ Malay, Chinese and Tamil. There are now 15 of these MOE Kindergartens. I visited one in Punggol. The kids are happy, and so their parents are happy too.",2017
"Every preschool a good preschool. As you can see, we have made good progress and a big reason is that we set up the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). It oversees the whole sector. It brings together all the ministries involved with preschool. It works with the operators to make sure everything goes well.",2017
"Now to take the preschools to the next level,¾we will roll out three more initiatives. First, we will create more places. As I said earlier, in the last five years, we have already created 50,000 more preschool places. But in the young towns, we are still short. In the next five years, we will create an additional 40,000 new places. This will bring the total number of preschool places to about 200,000, which will be almost double what we had.",2017
"Here is one centre, coming up in Sengkang West. The shortage of preschool places is mainly for the younger ones, ages zero to four, and those early years are critical for the childês development. So Anchor Operators will create more places just for this group. For a start, they will build Early Years Centres in new HDB developments. We will call them Early Years Centres for zero to four. Each Early Years Centre will partner a nearby MOE Kindergarten. From zero to four, your child can go to an Early Years Centre and when he reaches five and six, he or she will have a place reserved in that MOE Kindergarten, if you want to take it up.",2017
"Second, we will improve the quality of preschool education for ages five and six, in other words the K1s and the K2s. We have enough places already for this group. Now, we want to raise their standards further and MOE will lead the way. MOEês 15 Kindergartens have helped to establish a good standard at a reasonable price and parents know they can trust the MOE brand. MOE will scale up to 50 kindergartens over the next five years. And this way, MOE can make a bigger impact beyond its own MOE Kindergartens to influence and uplift the quality of the whole sector.",2017
"Thirdly, we will upgrade the preschool profession in order to attract good teachers and carers because teachers and carers make all the difference to our children. As a comparison, let us look at what we do with MOE teachers for primary, secondary and junior college. We train our teachers well. We have a National Institute of Education (NIE). Trainee teachers attend NIE programmes before they can start teaching. NIE does research and keeps up-to-date on the latest teaching methods. During their careers, periodically teachers return to NIE to upgrade themselves, and prepare for more senior roles. The MOE teachers do fulfilling work; they are paid competitively and they have good career paths. You can be a master teacher _ showing other teachers how to teach. You can be a subject specialist _ developing new curricula. Or you can be a school leader _ like a Vice-Principal, or a Principal, or a Cluster Superintendent. Because teachers are trained well, paid well and have good career prospects, good people take up teaching and we have a good education system.",2017
"We will take the same approach with preschool teachers: train them well, reward them well, and attract good, passionate people. I am glad that since we started upgrading and expanding preschools, people have been switching careers, like Ms Marie Luo. I met Marie when I visited the MOE Kindergarten at Punggol View. Marie used to work at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), overseeing productivity. But Marie loved to take care of young children, so when MOE Kindergartens started up, she gave it a try. She has been teaching for more than a year, and can look forward to a good career.",2017
"To encourage more people like Marie to join the preschool sector, we will raise the standing of the profession.¾We will set up a new institute to train teachers well. Today, there is no centralised institute for early childhood development. Instead we have many different preschool training programmes _ in Temasek Polytechnic, in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, ITE and the SEED Institute. We will now bring all these different programmes together, under a new centralised institute and we will call it the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC).",2017
"The NIEC will be like NIE but it will be for preschool teachers and carers. It will provide the full range of diploma and certificate programmes for preschool professionals. It will also have the scale to develop curricula, with different specialisations, like music, art, mother tongue or special education. Within a larger fraternity, the faculty will have more opportunities for professional development and progression.",2017
"We will provide training awards for students of the new institute. The awards will cover fees plus an allowance, so preschool teachers can make a strong start to their careers. We will also work with employers to ensure good career prospects and competitive pay. Over the last five years, as preschools expanded and upgraded, salaries have gone up. As we upgrade the profession, salaries need to improve further. And in particular, salaries must match career progression. Salaries have to be competitive not just for teachers, but also for the more senior specialists, supervisors and principals. Then you will have a career which is attractive, then good people will join. This will take a while but we must do it and we must get there. Only then can we upgrade the preschool sector and get good people to join and make it a career. Only then we can build a strong preschool system. So if you are passionate about kids, I hope you will consider this as a career.",2017
"In summary,¾we are doing three things to build up preschools and give young children a good start: More places for zero to four, better quality for five to six, raising the standing of teachers and carers. These changes will benefit all preschool kids. In addition, we are making a special effort for kids from low income and vulnerable families. These kids need more support, starting even earlier.",2017
"We have a programme for them: it is called KidSTART, which we piloted last year. Tan Chuan-Jin started this and is taking a close personal interest in it. Currently 400 families are on KidSTART. The mother gets onto the programme when she is expecting - ideally, in the first trimester. Even before the baby is born, trained officers visit the families at home, to support the expecting mother and impart practical skills and knowledge on health, nutrition and child development. After the baby arrives, the officers continue to coach the parents and they carry on doing so all the way through preschool. The early feedback on KidSTART has been promising. Parents say that their children are more talkative and expressive, and interact much better. And if these results are confirmed, we will scale up KidSTART to benefit more children.",2017
"I have described what we are doing to develop our children in practical ways but actually,¾we are emphasising preschools to achieve a broader social purpose because access to affordable, quality preschools will help level the playing field for young children. Today, every child goes to a good school. We want every child to go to a good preschool so that all children, regardless of family background, have the best possible start in life. We must do this because every child counts and if we get this right, we will foster social mobility and sustain a fair and just society. So it is a practical thing that we are doing but it is a strategic goal which we are aiming for.",2017
"And you heard or read ESM Goh at his National Day Dinner last night talking about this _ social mobility _ how important it is to make sure that we help all the kids, particularly those who do not have an advantaged background, to have a good start in life, not to be at a disadvantage, to be able to have equal opportunities just like everybody else. And we have to start early with KidSTART. We are starting before the baby is born, with preschools. And that is a strategic objective, and that is why I am talking about this subject at tonightês National Day Rally.",2017
"That is also why¾the Government is investing heavily in young children. We have doubled our annual spending on preschools in the last five years. In 2012, we have spent S$360 million. In 2017, this year we are spending S$840 million. So it is actually more than double. And in the next five years, we will double spending again. So by 2022, five years from now, we will be spending S$1,700 million. It is a heavy investment but worthwhile and necessary.",2017
"But all¾this will be for nought unless young couples do your part. Please have more babies! The champions are Sengkang West families. Sengkang Westês Lam Pin Min told me very proudly he is the advisor with the most babies in his ward _ 1,300 last year.¾PA organises –Embracing PArenthood” events for young parents and babies. Sengkang West has so many babies that Lam Pin Min had to organise multiple –Embracing PArenthood” events. I did just one. So here are some of his pictures - the first group, a second group, a third group, and the fourth. I think the only person who appears in more than one picture is Lam Pin Min. I assure you all the babies are different. So please go forth and do likewise!",2017
"My second topic tonight is our health, and specifically diabetes.¾You may not think diabetes is a major problem, but in fact, it is very serious in Singapore, particularly so for older people but increasingly for younger Singaporeans. Generally, Singaporeans think of ourselves as being fairly healthy. After all, we live quite long but it is not just about how many years you live, the quality of life matters greatly.",2017
"Let us take a close look with a live poll. You have got your Pigeonholes all set up. I would like to ask you two questions. If you are in the live audience tonight, please take out your phones and look at them and answer the questions. Are you ready? Let us begin. Question one _ what is the life expectancy of Singaporeans? What do you think? Is it 80 years old, 82 years old or 84 years old? Make a guess.",2017
"Well, most of you think it is 84. In fact, it is 82 but for women it is 84; for men it is 80. But at 82 years, it is among one of the longest in the world. But this is life expectancy and life expectancy includes both periods of good health and ill health. And you know from your own experience with ageing parents that when people grow old, they suffer from many ailments and frailties, often dragging on for years.",2017
"Let me ask question two _ on average, how many years of ill health do Singaporeans have in old age? What do you think? Four years, six years, eight years? I think most of you got it right. The answer is actually eight years _ a bit shorter for men, a bit longer for women, but on average eight years. On average, we live to 82 years and out of these 82 years in old age, we experience eight years of ill health. Eight years is a long time to be in ill health. It is tough on the old folks, and on their families too, particularly the caregivers.",2017
"What causes this ill health? One big reason is diabetes. And unfortunately, here compared to other developed countries, Singapore is almost world champion _ just behind the US. Overall, one in nine Singaporeans have diabetes. But the prevalence increases as you age. If you are my age, over 60, three in ten Singaporeans have diabetes. And since most Singaporeans will reach 60, that is a lot of us. In fact, if you look at yourself, and at the person sitting to your left, person sitting to your right, most probably at least one of you will have diabetes one day!",2017
"If you break it down by race, among the Chinese, 2.5 in 10 have diabetes; among the Malays, five in 10 have diabetes; and among the Indians, six in 10 have diabetes. These people age 60 and above. Half of Malays in my age group will have diabetes, and more than half of Indian in my age group will have diabetes, already have diabetes. This is a very serious problem, and especially for the Malays and Indians, is actually a health crisis. It is not an exaggeration.",2017
"The challenge with diabetes is that in the early stages, it is an invisible disease. You do not feel sick; there are hardly any symptoms. You may not even know that you have it. But if it is not treated, over time it can become very serious. If you look at the top causes of death in Singapore, diabetes does not appear there but actually, many common causes of death can be traced back to diabetes _ heart attack, stroke, kidney failure _ underlying causes, pre-disposing them to diabetes because diabetes damages all these organs. You may also lose your limbs, or go blind, and for the men, if nothing else worries you, diabetes can make you impotent!¾And that should cause you to sit up. So what can we do?",2017
"Typically, people will immediately ask: what is the Government doing? But with diabetes, the more important question is: What can I myself do, to change my lifestyle and diet, to minimise my risk? Personal choice and responsibility make all the difference to whether we get diabetes or not, and if we already have diabetes, whether we keep it under control. So what can each one of us do?",2017
"Let me offer four suggestions.¾First, please get regular medical check-ups. Find out whether you have diabetes or are at risk. Do not take the attitude that it is better not to know. You must want to know, because if you know your condition, then you can do something about it. Take advantage of the health checks at community events or MOHês subsidised screenings under Screen for Life programme and do not stop there.",2017
"Health checks only tell you how healthy or unhealthy you are. They do not cure your illness, or make you healthier, unless you do something with the results. So if your health check shows something is amiss, please see a doctor. Take the medicine that he prescribes. Follow his advice and surely, he will ask you to exercise more, which is also my second suggestion: please exercise more.",2017
"Exercise is good for you. It helps with your blood sugar, you blood pressure. It brings down your weight. It makes you feel better. But if you prefer something more fun, join a group activity. PA organises all sorts of activities every weekend _ Zumba, line dancing, brisk walking, taiji. Sign up to enjoy yourself with family and friends, and keep fit and healthy at the same time.",2017
"The easiest way to get more exercise is just to walk a little bit more every day. The doctor says to aim for 10,000 steps a day. But I know myself that 10,000 steps is not so easy to hit. I brisk walk for 40 minutes every morning. I walked this morning and today I checked and I am still only at 7,000 steps. The reason is because the rest of the day, I am sedentary _ sitting down at the computer, either at work or at home. And many Singaporeans are like me. Only when I have community events or walkabouts, or go on jalan jalan in the evenings, then I reach the target. But let us all make an effort to walk a bit more and work it into your daily routine. For example, walk to the MRT station, rather than take the feeder bus. Some people get off the train one stop early and walk the rest of the way home, or climb the stairs instead of taking the lift. I do that: when I go to the office every morning, I climb up the stairs, and if I go out and come back I climb up the stairs again. Coming down I take the lift. Let us do it together.",2017
"To motivate you, the Health Promotion Board is giving everybody in the audience today a free gift. It is a step tracker; I am wearing one. I am taking part in the 520 Million Step Challenge. Please collect yours on your way out and start walking tonight.",2017
"My third piece of advice is to eat less and eat healthily. I was looking at some of my old school photos recently. And it reminded me that when I was in school, the children were not as tall, and some of us were quite scrawny. Perhaps we were not eating enough and were a little bit under-nourished. So there were school milk programmes to top up our nutrition. Today, nutrition has improved and our children are taller and better built. Some are too well-built! I cannot show you a photograph, you know what I mean. And already among 5-year olds, one in 10 are overweight. And unfortunately, often baby fat does not go away, but carries into adulthood.",2017
"One reason we are putting on weight is because we are eating more. 20 years ago, we ate on average 2,100 calories every day, which is about the right amount if you are not in a very active physical life. This is 1998. Six years later, by 2004, it had gone up to 2,400 calories _ that is 300 calories more and that is equivalent to two extra scoops of ice cream every day. By 2010, six years later, it had gone up to 2,600 calories _ in other words, another 200 calories, which means another extra scoop of ice cream, plus topping!",2017
"I have not done the latest survey yet _ one should be coming in this year but I fear the trend is still up. Now, to burn off these extra 500 calories, these three extra scoops of ice cream, you need to run more than an hour every day! How many of you run more than one hour every day? Most of us do not, so obesity has gone up. The key is to be disciplined, and to make the right choices in food.",2017
"Mr Lee Kuan Yew was very disciplined about his food intake. Charles Chong told me a story: Mr Lee once invited him to lunch. He was the only guest. When the main course was served, the plate came up, he looked at the plate, one and a half pieces of steak _ one small steak and one half, tiny piece, one and a half portions for two people. Charles Chong was the guest, so he was served first. He did not know what to do. So out of respect for Mr Lee, he took the tiny, half piece. Mr Lee stopped him. He said, –That is my piece. You take the other one!” So like Mr Lee, we all can decide to eat less, and watch our weight.",2017
"Unfortunately, not all of us do that. In fact,¾we are not just eating more, we are also eating less healthily. Lifestyles have changed. In the past, fewer wives worked. They could prepare healthy, home-cooked meals. Now, increasingly both the husband and the wife work. So families eat out more often. They buy char kway teow or roti prata at hawker centres, or increasingly fast food. But actually, even if you eat out, you can still choose healthier dishes like yong tau foo, sliced fish soup or soto ayam. There are such choices. More hawkers serve healthy alternatives _ less oil, less sugar, less salt, but tasting almost as good. In fact, if you get used to it, tasting better, give it a try!",2017
"If you do cook at home, make small changes, like replacing white rice with brown or mixed grain rice. I know many of us are used to eating white rice but white rice is bad for diabetes because it has very high glycaemic index (GI), which means white rice may not taste sweet. But the effect of eating white rice is almost like eating sugar and when you eat white rice, your blood sugar will shoot up. If you have always eaten white rice, brown rice may take some getting used to.",2017
"Every week, my Ministers and I meet over lunch before our Cabinet meeting. We call it our PreCab Lunch. Some years ago when Khaw Boon Wan was Minister for Health, he suggested to me that we switch to brown rice because it is healthier. So I polled the Ministers for their views; everyone agreed. At least nobody objected. Ever since, I have been serving brown rice at PreCab lunches. But only very, very recently, I found out that some Ministers do not like brown rice. So when we come to PreCab Lunch, they do not have rice and they go home and they eat white rice for dinner! Now I will need another very serious Cabinet discussion to decide what we should serve at PreCab lunch.",2017
"As a compromise, I am thinking of trying white rice mixed together with brown rice. It is not quite as healthy but it is better tasting than all brown rice and it is healthier than all-white rice. So at the reception later, I am going to get you to try first. I am serving mixed grain fried rice _ white and brown mixed together! Let me know what you think, and if you like it, please tell my Ministers.",2017
"I told Seah Kian Peng about our plans and he said that NTUC FairPrice will help me to encourage Singaporeans to eat more brown rice and healthy food. From tomorrow till the end of August, FairPrice will have special discounts and offers on healthy food, including brown rice, so do not hesitate. Let us start eating healthier today!",2017
"My fourth piece of advice is to cut down on soft drinks. Soft drinks contain a lot of refined sugar, which is very bad for you. Just one can of soft drink can contain eight cubes of sugar and that is more than you need for one whole day. If you drink soft drinks every day, you are overloading your system with sugar, and significantly increasing your risk of diabetes.",2017
"Our children are most at risk because soft drinks are part of their lifestyle. When a young man takes his girlfriend to the cinema, how can they not buy popcorn and soft drinks!¾And we are seeing more diabetes cases among young people, Type 2 Diabetes, including children, and that means big trouble for their health.",2017
"That is why in our schools, tuckshops can only sell drinks containing six per cent or less of sugar. But that does not really solve the problem because the kids then just go outside the school compound and buy the full-strength sweetened drinks at the convenience store.",2017
"We are scouting around for solutions. Some countries _ several European ones, Mexico, Brunei _ they have tried a sugar tax. UK and Chile also placed warning labels on drinks with high sugar content. But it is not clear yet if these measures work. Others have tried to limit the size of soft drinks _ no more Big Gulp. But not sure that will work either because people may just buy two smaller gulps instead. Nobody has found an ideal solution yet but we are scanning the horizon and if someone comes up with one that works, we will study it and we will implement it. Meanwhile, we must do something about this problem of soft drinks and sugar.",2017
"As a first step, we have got the soft drink producers to agree to reduce the sugar in all their soft drinks sold in Singapore. This will help. But ultimately, what to drink is a personal choice. The best is to drink plain water.¾Better still, drink PUB water.",2017
"I just described four simple things each one of us can do: get a check-up, exercise more, watch your diet, cut down on sugar. It requires commitment, adjustments to our habits, our lifestyles and diet. But the payoff is large and can be done.",2017
"I give you an example, Mr Song Hee Pheow, who is a taxi driver. Mr Song got a check-up through a programme started by HPB for taxi drivers _ –Check car, Check body”. Send your taxi for servicing. While you wait, send your own body for health screening. Kill two birds with one stone! Mr Song did that and discovered he had diabetes. His health coach told him to change his lifestyle. So he decided to do something about it. Instead of taking the lift to his flat, he climbed the five floors up every day. He also started exercising regularly. He ate less fried food, and cut his sugar intake. In six months, he lost 4kg. And when he saw his doctor at the polyclinic recently, the doctor said _ Your blood sugar is good, well done!",2017
"If Mr Song can do it, each one of us can do it too. I am sharing this with you hoping that you will take it to heart but actually I am also preaching to myself because I also have to watch my own condition, because I have a family history of diabetes.",2017
"My paternal grandmother had diabetes. Several of my uncles had diabetes. My father did not but that is probably because he watched his diet and his weight very carefully and he was extremely disciplined about exercising. And for diabetes, genes play a part but your choices make the difference, and that is why I have to be careful.I do a test for fasting blood sugar twice a year. If the reading is below six, you are okay. If it is above six, well you need to investigate further. So far, I am okay. I am below six but I am not very far below six, so I know I have to be careful. And to stay in the safe zone I weigh myself every day, and I adjust my food intake. I exercise daily. I watch what I eat and drink _ wholemeal bread instead of white bread, Teh O Kosong instead of Teh. Teh Gah Dai is completely out of the question. But if the dessert is chendol, it cannot be helped; I will just take a little bit. It takes effort and discipline but it can be done. So I hope you will join me. Start today, so that we can live healthily and live well.",2017
"My third topic tonight is a Smart Nation. What is Smart Nation about? Some think it is about each person owning two handphones, or learning to play Pokemon Go, or having the fastest internet connection. Others talk about e-commerce, the Internet of Things, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and big data. Those are all part of it, but not the whole story.",2017
"Smart Nation is about Singapore taking full advantage of IT. Using IT comprehensively to create new jobs, new business opportunities, to make our economy more productive, to make our lives more convenient. To make this an outstanding city in which to live, work and play.",2017
"We have a natural advantage. We are compact. We are highly connected. Our people are digitally literate. Our schools are teaching students basic computing and robotics. But while we have the right ingredients, we lag behind other cities in several areas. For example, electronic payments.",2017
"China has gone the furthest with e-payments. Lim Swee Say told me how he found out about this. He was in Shanghai a few years ago, queuing to buy gao lak, chestnuts, at a roadside hawker. He saw people in front of him waving their handphones before taking their chestnuts and leaving, without paying any cash. So being Singaporean, he thought there must be some special offer. When it came his turn, he confidently said, I do not need the special offer, I will pay the full price in cash! The hawker did not say anything _ just gave him a quizzical look and pointed him to the QR code. And that was then he realised the QR code was for WeChat Pay and he was the suaku one!",2017
"Indeed, in major Chinese cities, cash has become obsolete. Even debit and credit cards are becoming rare. Everyone is using WeChat Pay or AliPay and these apps are linked to your bank account. To pay someone money, just pick up the phone, scan his QR Code. And you can use these apps for nearly all payments.",2017
"You can buy snacks from a roadside stall like Swee Say. You can see the QR code here, there is another one here. You can pay for a taxi ride. You can even tip the waiter at a restaurant. So when visitors from China find that they have to use cash here, they ask: how can Singapore be so backward?",2017
"In Singapore, we too have e-payments, but we have too many different schemes and systems that do not talk to one another. So people have to carry multiple cards, and businesses have to install multiple readers. It is inconvenient for consumers, it is costly for businesses. And the result is, most of us still prefer cash and cheques _ 6 in 10 transactions are cash and cheques.",2017
"We must simplify and integrate our systems. MAS has been working hard at this _ integrating the different systems into one _ so now at last we have one single unified terminal that can read different cards. MAS and the banks have also rolled out a new service, called PayNow. PayNow links your mobile phone number to your bank account. So you can pay and receive money using your mobile banking app. You can pay money to somebodyês mobile number, if he is on PayNow. And if you are on PayNow, other people can pay you just using your mobile number. So you use your app you send $20, you know his phone number, you send it to him, it pops up on his account. It is done. Different bank, notwithstanding, money goes across. Does not matter if the bank is different. In fact, you do not have to know his bank account number, or which bank he is using.",2017
"Soon you will be able to use QR codes too. It is convenient, it is cheap. It is safe. There is no credit card fee. So next time I am at a hawker centre, I look forward to paying for my meal with PayNow. Then I will know it is fully working.",2017
"Another area where IT can help is public safety and security. I chair the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council. The Council met recently. The members, some Singaporeans, some international experts. I was struck by what one of the Council members said _ that Singapore had a reputation as one of the safest cities in the world, so she was surprised to find that when it came to using IT to make a city safe, other cities were ahead of Singapore. I told her she was quite right.",2017
"Many cities already have comprehensive CCTV and sensor networks. And they also can integrate the inputs from all the sources, analyse and make sense of the information, and respond promptly if there is an incident or an emergency. Take for example the Boston Bombings. During the Boston Marathon in April 2013, about four years ago. Terrorists detonated two bombs near the finish line. There were many casualties. The Boston Police pulled together a huge amount of information from CCTVs, social media, license plate readers, plus video and photos contributed by the public. They combed through all this data. Within three days, the police identified the two bombers, and released footage of them. And this prevented the bombers from moving around freely. The police soon tracked them down, killed one, and arrested the other.",2017
"In Singapore we started building our own network of sensors, especially CCTV cameras, some time ago. The Police installed CCTVs at HDB void decks and lift landings to deal with loan sharks. And it has worked. We see fewer cases of –owe-money-pay-money” now.¾They do not paint your door but I just read in the newspapers the –owe-money-pay-money” has gone online now. But at least the physical harassment is down. Residents are greatly relieved.",2017
"Other agencies have different sensors. PUB has sensors to detect water levels in drains to know whether it is likely to flood or not. LTA has cameras to monitor traffic conditions and deter illegal parking. The camera is quite small, and the sign is very big. Hotels, shopping centres and office buildings also have their own CCTV systems. But we have not brought all the different systems together.",2017
"When the Little India riot happened in December 2013, we were caught a little flat-footed. There were too few CCTV cameras monitoring Little India. We had to rely on footage posted by the public on social media. Since then we have made progress. We are building an integrated national sensor network. We are making –every lamp-post a smart lamp-post”, meaning it can mount different types of sensors on any of the lampposts. We are installing more CCTV cameras in public places. We are combining inputs from different sources _ police, LTA, hotels and commercial buildings, even handphones, which are effectively sensors on the ground.",2017
"And we are learning to analyse this combined data, for example, using artificial intelligence to automatically flag when something unusual is happening. So if I have 10,000 cameras, I do not need 1,000 people watching those cameras. I just need maybe just 10 people. Each person can watch 1,000 cameras and if the AI detects that something funny is happening, it will pop up and the man can pay attention and a response can be directed. So one day if we have an incident like the Boston Bombings, then the Home Team can assess the situation quickly and respond promptly, or even pre-empt it from happening.",2017
"This is a major project. Meanwhile, we are working on smaller projects too, to solve daily problems. Like paying for parking. We have ERP, we have mobile phones, and yet we are still tearing parking coupons, which we have been doing for 40 years. Dozens of other cities have parking apps. Why do we not? So I pushed HDB and URA to go digital. And I am glad that with GovTechês help, we have now developed an app for street parking _ and it is called parking.sg. Actually they should call it –parking lady lai liao”. You only pay for however long you park. If it is 18 minutes, you pay for 18 minutes, and the app will alert you when your session is about to end. If you want to park longer, you can extend your session remotely. No need to rush back to your car to add coupons before the parking lady puts a summons on you. We will launch parking.sg by October. And it will save motorists a lot of unnecessary parking hassles.",2017
These small projects are instructive. They show what can be done. They help us learn and adapt to new technology in our daily lives and they prepare us to make bigger adjustments which are necessary later on.,2017
"I give you another example from the retail business. Traditional retail is being transformed by technology. People are shopping online. Delivery services like Redmart, HonestBee and Amazon Prime now have become popular. Online retailers are also setting up brick-and-mortar stores, with a twist. Like in Seattle, Amazon has just opened a drive-up grocery store. You order your items online. You choose a pick-up time, maybe when you are on your way home from work. At your allotted time, you drive to the store to do the pickup. A licence plate reader will register your arrival. Your groceries are brought out to your car. It is not available here yet, but perhaps it is not so far away.",2017
"This means¾retail stores will not disappear. But traditional stores and businesses must adapt and reinvent themselves. Use technology to offer customers more efficient, more convenient service. I am glad to see that our businesses are responding. Supermarkets have had self-service counters for some time now, which are popular with shoppers. FairPrice has taken it further. They have opened an unmanned, cashless Cheers store at Nanyang Polytechnic. There is no cashier in this convenience store, no staff at all. To buy an item, you simply take it off the shelf, you do a self-checkout. There is a back-end system which tracks the inventory and automatically restocks when the stocks run down. It saves manpower and costs for Cheers, offers convenience and savings for customers. I hear Cheers is going to push out another store like this soon.",2017
"We have got continue to push such projects. The world is changing. Unless we change with it, we will fall behind. Singapore must always stay with the leaders to attract talent and business, to live up to our own expectations of what we ought to be and can be.",2017
"To do such Smart Nation projects, big or small, we need engineers, programmers, data analysts, technicians. We need people with the skills. We need managers with the understanding. We need leaders with the dare and the courage and the organisational ability to make it happen. There is a worldwide shortage of such talent and skills. But we must urgently build up our talent pool. The Government is offering scholarships and sponsorships for engineering. The SkillsFuture and Professional Conversion Programmes will help Singaporeans build up and upgrade their skills. This is one direct way a Smart Nation will create new jobs and opportunities for our people.",2017
"When we started out with economic development, we put a lot of emphasis on engineering and science. In fact, when we gave scholarships, almost all the scholarships were for engineering but in the last decade, two decades, the trend has shifted. First it was balanced, from engineering to economics and liberal arts, which was a good sign. Then it went all the way and nowadays most of the students going on scholarship are not doing engineering and sciences. They are doing liberal arts, which are good subjects but I need a balance. We really must encourage our best students, a good proportion of them, to take up engineering, sciences and computer sciences. You come back, there are many things to do where your skills will be very valuable.",2017
"Smart Nation is for all of us, young and old. We are making every effort to bring everyone along - through our schools, through SkillsFuture, and through PA. Many Singaporeans are using IT to create jobs or solve social problems.¾In my Malay speech, I described how Syafiq grew his company, and now Riverwood employs 120 workers. In my Chinese speech, you saw how Gillian Teeês company, Homage, gave many seniors and their familiesê peace of mind, by providing on-demand caregiving services.",2017
"If you know about IT, you can share your knowledge with others, to help bring them up to speed, like Mr Tariam Singh. Tariam is 70. He does not look it but he is. He is a volunteer Silver Infocomm Wellness Ambassador. He helps fellow seniors learn new IT skills. Here he is in action.",2017
"Tariam speaks many languages. He teaches in Hokkien, Mandarin, Malay, and Punjabi. He shows seniors how to use messaging apps and social media, to connect with family and friends. He brings people together to learn, and make friends with one another. And this is how we will become a Smart Nation together _ by taking the initiative to improve ourselves; by helping others and bettering all our lives; by looking towards the future and making Singapore a happening place where people want to live.",2017
"Tonight, I have spoken about three things we are doing to build our future. Making our preschools better because we want every child to start well and have the best chance in life. Declaring war on diabetes so that we can stay well, live healthily, and enjoy the fruits of our labours. Building a Smart Nation to create opportunities for all of us and keep Singapore a leading city in the world.",2017
"Why are we so preoccupied with the future? Whom are we doing this for? Not just for ourselves, but for our children and future generations.",2017
"In January, I presented Edusave Awards to residents of Teck Ghee. It was a reward and an encouragement for the students who have done well and a proud moment for their parents who worked hard to support them and who encouraged them to excel.",2017
"One family I met moved me. This is Adam, receiving his Edusave Merit Award. You can see the smile on his face. After the ceremony, I met Adamês father, Aziz. He showed me an old picture. It was a photo of himself when he was a schoolboy, receiving an SBC House Union Bursary from me _ we were both much younger _ in 1986! So, I have presented awards to father and son, 31 years apart.",2017
"It was a special moment for Aziz, for Adam, also for me. Recently, I met the grandfather, Ahmad. Ahmad was a gardener with SBC, the old Mediacorp. This is Ahmad down here, Aziz and Adam. And that is why Aziz qualified for the Bursary all those years ago!",2017
"It is my Governmentês duty to build for our future, so that every family can be like Ahmad, Aziz and Adam. It has ever been so, and it must always be so. In the beginning when we had little else, we had faith in our future. We believed every family should have the chance to work hard and do well, and improve their lives. We wanted every generation to outdo their parents. We strove mightily to make this happen.",2017
"This familyês story started with Ahmad, who belonged to the pioneer generation. When Aziz was born, he could go to a good school and receive every help to further his education. In 1986, when Aziz received his bursary, Singapore was going through a difficult time. We were just coming out of a severe recession. We had taken drastic measures to revive the economy, including a sharp and painful CPF cut.",2017
"But even as we dealt with the crisis, we never stopped building for the future. We continued to improve our schools, expand our polytechnics and universities, and upgrade the old Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) _ this is the Ang Mo Kio VITB, just across the road from where we are now _ to build todayês ITE.",2017
"Aziz could work hard and do well. He graduated with a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Singapore Polytechnic. He became an engineer working for semiconductor multinationals. He upgraded himself along the way and earned a Masterês Degree in Engineering Management. As the new bio-medical sciences industry took off, Aziz was headhunted to be a senior maintenance engineer with GSK, a pharmaceutical multinational.",2017
"Now it is his son, Adamês turn. Adam is growing up in a completely different world. He will need different skills to compete in the future economy. He will have to study and work hard like his father _ there is no escaping that. But like his father, he too will have the opportunity to thrive.",2017
"Adam is now studying in Teck Ghee Primary School. He and all his TGPS schoolmates will learn how to code and programme, and if they are keen, to do robotics and digital media. We are giving children like Adam strong foundations so that when they start working, they can take up good jobs and seize the opportunities and make this a Smart Nation. Perhaps one day Adam may launch his own startup! Why not?",2017
"This is the Singapore of the last half century: Ahmad, a gardener; Aziz, a pharmaceutical engineer; and Adam, a bright future ahead of him. Every generation striving and building for the next; keeping our eyes on tomorrow and investing in our children; undaunted by challenges and disruptions, instead working together to overcome every obstacle, seize every opportunity and realise a bright future for all of us.",2017
Good night!,2017
"My fellow Singaporeans, good evening again. A lot has happened since my last National Day Rally. We had a good General Election and now we have the next generation of leaders firmly in place. We have been working hard to lay the foundation for the next 50 years, SkillsFuture, the SG future conversations and projects, the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE).",2016
"This last month has been good for Singapore. The first NDP after SG50, in the new National Stadium, went well. In Rio, Team Singapore did us proud.",2016
"But while we celebrate, we should continue to prepare for our future.",2016
"Therefore tonight, I want to speak seriously about the challenges we face. My subjects will not all be easy or fun ones. Some sensitive topics may even make us feel a little bit uncomfortable. But it is my responsibility to talk candidly about them and tell you honestly what lies ahead. What we need to do to progress together.",2016
"I want to ask three questions. One, how do we progress together? Two, how do we secure our place in the world? And three, how do we ensure good politics for Singapore?",2016
"First question, how do we progress?",2016
"We aspire to be among the leading cities in the world, New York, Shanghai, London, Tokyo, Sydney. One of the shining spots in the world, in human civilization, where people want to be. Because here, you can do great things. A good place to bring up children where our young continue to enjoy opportunities and a better life.",2016
"At the same time, we want Singapore to be our home, where we belong, where our families feel safe and secure, where we build a compassionate and inclusive society, leaving no one behind.",2016
"We know what we want, but how do we get there?",2016
"Among all the economic issues we are dealing with, slower growth, helping people to upgrade, strengthening social safety nets - the defining challenge which we face in this era is disruption. Things are changing fast, old models are not working, new models are coming thick and fast and we are having to adjust and to keep up. Because of technology, globalisation, and the disruption will happen over and over again relentlessly.",2016
"I shall just use the familiar example of the taxi business. Uber and Grab, these are private car hire services. They compete with taxis in cities all over the world. You open an app, it matches you with the nearest car. The car comes, you can see it coming on your map, picks you up where you are, takes you where you need to go. You tap on the app again, you rate the driver, the driver rates you and you pay. No need to book a cab by phone, no need to hail a cruising cab along the street. I am sure some of you came by Uber or Grab tonight. Anybody? A few hands. Some of you must have taken Comfort and other taxis tonight. Anybody? Taxi drivers must be getting worried, but I am sure there are. How does Uber and Grab work? They grab data from users. They analyse the travel patterns, they adjust the charging to match supply and demand. So if there are lots of people wanting rides, not enough cars, fares goes up, more drivers turn up. If there are a lot of drivers, not enough rides, and fare goes down, maybe more people will turn up wanting to ride, maybe some drivers will go home. It is a new way of doing it and everywhere where there is Uber and Grab, or in China, Didi Kuaidi, and in other cites similar services with different names. They are disrupting the taxi industry. Disrupting, but commuters are benefitting. Better service, more responsive, faster. But taxi companies and drivers find their business affected. In some cities like London, or Sydney, or Jakarta, or Paris, the drivers have staged protests, blockades. They want the governments to block the new services, to protect their existing ways of doing business.",2016
"What do we do in Singapore? We can respond to disruptive change like this in two ways. We can close ourselves off, try to stop people from using the new technology. You must do things the way you have always done it. So Uber out, Grab out. Any new services coming along, no to it too. We impose restrictions, we protect their old ways, the taxi companies and we force everybody to stick to that. But we will be left behind and our commuters will lose out and our economy will suffer. The other way is to embrace change. Let the disruption happen. You cannot stop it but you can adjust to it. Let the commuters enjoy better service but help the incumbents and especially help the taxi drivers to adapt to the changes. That is what we are doing. We are updating the rules to foster fair competition while protecting commuters. We require all the drivers whether taxis, Uber, Grab or anybody else, you must have the right insurance, you must have clean records.",2016
"As we adjust the rules, the companies will have to adapt and they can adapt. I think the taxi drivers are watching this very carefully. I know quite a few are feeling anxious. I talked to Ang Hin Kee who often brings them to his grassroots events. I talked to them directly and they asked what is going to happen? Will they still have a livelihood? I said you can also drive for the other side. They said yes, but we have to work hard. But they can still make a living. Our taxi drivers have been level-headed about the competition. They have talked to us, they have made useful recommendations on how to level the playing field. Some of you have actually told me that you welcome the competition because now that you can go to the other side, the taxi companies are taking the taxi drivers more seriously and responding with better offers, new technology, enabling you to compete. On the other side, we also talked to the new operators and the new operators tell us, it is not so easy to compete in Singapore because unlike other cities, in Singapore, the taxi business is quite efficient. It is competitive, the drivers work hard and so, they have to work hard to get their share of the pie. So there is competition. The playing field is in play. Not quite level. Taxis still have some extra rules. They have to drive a minimum mileage every day. I know this is a sore point. There are other statutory requirements which make taxis more expensive to operate. But then I remind the taxi drivers you also enjoy some advantages. As a driver told me, they can •sweep the floorê. I said, –What does that mean, •sweep the floorê?” That means you can pick up from the kerb. Uber and Grab cannot do street hails. There are other advantages too so we will progressively sort all these things out. But I think we all know that we cannot stop progress and even Uber and Grab are going to be disrupted and the next round, maybe no drivers but instead, driverless cars running a taxi service. In fact in Singapore next year, we are going to start a trial of driverless taxis in One-North.",2016
"So the same thing is happening in other industries as well, like retail. Shopping habits are changing, people are going online. Used to buy groceries from FairPrice. Now, you can shop online, somebody may go to the shop for you, collect it for you and deliver the goods to you the next day to your doorstep or maybe to lockers in your neighbourhood for online retailers like this POPStation. People are also buying from overseas stores, Amazon, Taobao, which has wider range and often cheaper. Orchard Road shops are affected. They have become places where people look, see, and go home to buy. You can still do business, but different and not so easy. The retail business is very big in Singapore, 125,000 workers, 16,000 companies. As retail gets disrupted, we have to anticipate what is coming, we have to help companies and workers to adapt. But it is not just doom and gloom because when you disrupt, you also create new jobs. Like now, if people order online, it still has to come to you, either to the box or to the house. So the delivery vans doing delivery service, they will have business. As a transport and financial hub, if people are buying online all over Southeast Asia and Asia, we can be in that business. The goods ship through Singapore, the financing has to be done somewhere, we can be a major player in this new logistics chain. There will be new opportunities, data analytics, digital marketing, figuring out who is buying what, who is interested in which item, how to get the item to the person who wants it.",2016
"Every industry is disrupted, but every industry is disrupted differently. So Economic Development Board (EDB), SPRING, Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), International Enterprise Singapore (IE Singapore) will work with these industries one by one, with the trade associations, with the chambers of commerce, to develop specific programs to help the companies, to use new technologies, to invest in skills.",2016
"At the same time we also need an overall strategy to find out, to be able to spot whether changes are coming from, to respond when things are disrupted and to keep our economy growing. So that our companies can be resilient, able to keep on finding new ways to do business, able to keep on employing Singaporeans in good jobs. And we have to prepare our workers to do good jobs, different jobs, new jobs, during their lives.",2016
That is what the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) is doing. CFE is chaired by Heng Swee Keat and Iswaran.,2016
It is not quite done but I will give you a preview of three of the themes from the CFE project.¾,2016
"First, to build new capabilities.",2016
"Secondly, to promote entrepreneurship. And thirdly, to develop new skills amongst our people. First of all, we will help our companies to develop new capabilities. And one area where we can do this, which is promising, is digital. Because Singapore is well-connected, we have got fibre everywhere and our people are IT savvy. You just look at this. Where do you think this is and what do you think they are doing? Somebody did that in the audience. That is a Pokemon and Pokemon Go has gone viral. But it shows that everybody has a phone, everybody is online, everybody is comfortable, able to use digital and I think there are opportunities in digital. It is virtual, it does not require large areas of land, it will save labour and we can do business with anyone from anywhere.",2016
"We have already got companies doing interesting things in the digital space. Like Ascent Solutions. It is a logistics small and medium enterprise (SME). In the logistics business, there are two major problems. One, delays in customs clearance because when you go from border to border, somebody wants to look inside your box. And secondly, theft. That means pilferage or maybe the whole container disappears. So Ascent Solutions came up with a digital solution. They were backed by SPRING and they developed a tracking device and a lock called iSpot. The iSpot is a lock on the container which has a Global Positioning System (GPS) inside. Secure, tamper-proof and you can be sure that what is inside stays inside and what is outside does not get inside. There is no need for the customs officers to inspect the box over and over again. The owner can track where the box is, all the time, 24/7. So with IE Singaporeês support, Ascent has taken to East Africa and there are more 10,000 iSpots in East Africa. From Kenya to Uganda, it used to take 20 days to travel because there are ten checkpoints to clear along the way. Each time you wait and you may have to grease palms. But now, no need to clear customs over and over again because of the tamper-proof lock. In two days, you get there. It is a game-changer. I am very proud that a Singapore company is doing good business in Africa with help from IE.",2016
"Besides digital we also need to build capabilities in other sectors. We have some SMEs which can compete with the best in the world and we should help them to grow, to scale up. I mentioned Fragrance Bak Kwa and Luzerne just now in my Chinese speech but we can also hold our own in engineering.¾",2016
HOPE Technik is a home-grown engineering SME that has been making a name for itself. It is ten years old now and it employs 110 people. You know some of the things they make because they make Red Rhinos and Hazmat Control Vehicles for Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). They also make drones and specialised industrial and commercial equipment.¾,2016
"Four years ago, HOPE Technik won a tender by Airbus. They beat top engineering firms in the world for this tender and their job was to build a scale model of a spaceplane. A spaceplane is a combination of a spaceship and an airplane. It is a scale model for Airbusê civilian spacecraft programme. They built it, they loaded it with sensors, they tested it successfully, took it high up in the air, flew it down instrumentally. It is part of the research towards building a real spaceplane. So maybe in 20 yearsê time when civilians go into space and spaceflight is a reality for all of us, then we can say a Singaporean firm helped this to happen.",2016
"Today, HOPE Technik is building autonomous robots, used in different settings; semiconductor plants, logistics warehouses, hospitals. They navigate themselves, open doors, go around obstacles, and avoid bumping into people",2016
"HOPE Technik focuses sharply on engineering, which it applies to niche areas. It is able to create opportunities for itself, it is able to find new markets, and it is able to create new jobs for Singaporeans. We must build this sort of new, deep capabilities in every sector, engineering, food manufacturing, logistics, and the Government will support companies to do so.¾",2016
"Beyond building up capabilities, we should also promote entrepreneurship. Because engineering is one thing but entrepreneurship, that dare to try something new, to venture. That is a different mindset and entrepreneurs have that mindset, need that mindset and we need people like that in our society. They play an important role, not just because they are doing business for themselves and doing well and creating jobs and prosperity and making it big. But also because they are resourceful, they are optimistic. They give the society a confidence. Anything is possible, anything you can do, and I will try and do better. And we need that mindset in Singapore. Through our own actions, we can change the world. And if we fail, we try again. If we fail, we try again. We refuse to give up. We keep on trying. One day, we will succeed.",2016
"We started a small experiment at Block 71 Ayer Rajah five years ago. Block 71 was about to be demolished. Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) decided instead, do not knock it down. Renovate it, launch it as an incubator. An incubator is a building which offers spaces for rent to entrepreneurs to start companies. This blue building, this one, is Block 71. It looks like an old JTC building with a new coat of paint. But a lot of bright ideas inside. We were offering not just buildings and their services, but also co-funding from government agencies. It started with a small group of start-ups. It has been very successful. Now, it has expanded to Block 73 and Block 79. So now they have changed the name and they have called it JTC Launchpad. We even have a Block 71 in San Francisco to help our start-ups tap the United States (US) market and the Silicon Valley network. I visited Block 71, both here in Ayer Rajah and also in San Francisco (SF). This one is talking to our young people in SF. Many of them starting their own companies.",2016
"One company which came out of the original Block 71 is Zimplistic. Zimplistic makes the Rotimatic. The Rotimatic is the worldês first automatic Chapati and Roti maker. You put in the flour, you put in the oil, you put in the water, and you press a button and after a minute, out comes fresh hot Chapati and Roti, one per minute. And if you have made Chapati you will know what hard work it is. In the old days, the women did the work, but nowadays the women are out at work, so they do not have time to make Chapati any more every day. But with the Rotimatic, the family can still have Chapati for dinner. The Rotimatic was developed by Ms Pranoti Nagarkar. She is a mechanical engineer by training and her husband, Rishi, who does the software. They brought it to market with SPRINGês help. It has generated a lot of interest internationally and later on, you can try Rotimatic Chapati at the reception and tell Pranoti and Rishi what you think about it.",2016
"Our schools are giving our students exposure to start-up hotspots all over the world. National University of Singapore (NUS) has overseas colleges in lots of places, including in the Silicon Valley, and I will just show you, these are some of the places, guess where? This one is Fudan in Shanghai. This one is Stanford in San Francisco, or near San Francisco. This one is in Tel Aviv, you can see the Hebrew street sign. But we are all over _ New York, Beijing, Munich, Lausanne, and Stockholm. Students go there and they have a chance to attend classes at universities there. They interact with start-up founders and angel investors. They intern at the start-ups there and they may get bitten by the bug and start something, try to change the world.¾",2016
"It is still early days, but it looks promising. The start-ups are growing, and the investors are paying attention. Venture capitalists and some of the big tech companies are coming here, like Google, Paypal and Facebook. They are setting up engineering things here because they see promising talent and interesting start-ups. And maybe the next Google, Facebook or Alibaba may come from Singapore.",2016
"A strong economy, therefore, needs capabilities. You need the entrepreneurs, but you also need a skilled workforce and if we give our workforce skills, we will enable them to hold better jobs, earn better pay. And that is why SkillsFuture is crucial.¾",2016
"For those people who are already working, to help them, we are offering courses to upgrade their skills and to achieve deeper mastery. SkillsFuture offers all sorts of courses, nursing, precision engineering and pre-school education. Not just courses, but pathways to upgrade yourself in your job. That is what Madam Janessa Puvaneswari Kumaran is doing. She became a pre-school teacher with the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) about ten years ago. Now, she is a Senior Teacher and she has taken up the SkillsFuture Study Award to do an Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Leadership at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Janessa aspires to become a centre principal. I am sure she will get there and become a great Early Childhood Educator.",2016
"Besides upgrading workers in their present careers, we are also helping workers who get retrenched, or who change careers, to transition and find new jobs. It is tough to lose your job, especially when you are young or when you are not so young and you have family to support. But there is help available. Programmes under Adapt and Grow, the Professional Conversion Programmes, and the Career Support Programme (CSP). They train you, help you to pick up new skills, move to a different industry, and settle into a new job.",2016
"NTUC is doing good work, helping not just rank-and-file workers but PMEs too, like Gerard Peck. Gerard worked 30 years at a bank in IT security, now in his 50s. He left the bank last year. He found it hard to find a new job so he signed up for the CSP. The CSP helped his new employer pay a portion of his wages for some time. It made it easier for his new employer to take him on. With e2iês help, Gerard landed a job as Head of IT at another company early this year. The company is Datapost. Datapost is an SME in printing and mailing solutions. It is the biggest print bureau in the region. Gerard has found his former banking experience useful, helping Datapost to transform their IT system and developing new business strategies for Datapost. Well done!¾",2016
"I have talked about developing capabilities, encouraging entrepreneurship and developing skills. Earlier in my Chinese speech, I also discussed strengthening our safety nets. These are the ways our economy and our workers can thrive amidst disruption. This is how we can progress together and thrive in a competitive and dangerous world. It is a dangerous world.¾",2016
"My second question is, how do we secure our place in the world?¾",2016
"To start off with, we have to defend ourselves and that is why we have the Singapore Armed Forces.¾",2016
"But as a small country, we also need a network of friends. Friends in our neighbourhood and also friends among the big powers all over the world, even in faraway places.¾",2016
"We are a little bit like Mongolia. I visited Mongolia one month ago. Area-wise, they are bigger than us, population-wise, about the same as us. But similar, because their two neighbours, are much bigger than them. One is China, the other is Russia. If you ask the Mongolians how many neighbours they have, they will tell you they have three neighbours, China and Russia. Who is the third neighbour? The –third neighbour” is Japan, the US, the South Koreans and the EU. These are all Mongoliaês –third neighbours”.",2016
"In the same way, Singapore also has two neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and we have –third neighbours” all over the world. I have been busy with foreign trips this year because the world is important and we have to keep up links with them. Beyond Malaysia and Indonesia, our most important relationships are with China and with America.",2016
"I just came back from an Official Visit to the US at the invitation of President Obama. It was a significant gesture. The last time a Singapore PM was officially welcomed in the White House with ceremonies was more than 30 years ago when Mr Lee Kuan Yew went in 1985. My visit reflects Singapore's warm and deep friendship with America, spanning many areas: economics, education, defence, security, people to people ties. We benefit from the dynamic and innovative US economy. We admire their warmth, openness and generosity. My visit was also a signal that the US values its friends and partners and appreciates Singapore support for the role that America has played in the Asia-Pacific for more than 70 years since the war, spreading prosperity through trade and investments, maintaining security and stability, enabling all the countries in the region to thrive and to compete peacefully. Singapore hopes that the US would keep on doing this even as China's influence grows.¾",2016
"At the same time, Singapore is good friends with China. I will be visiting China next month, including to Chongqing, where we have a third government-to-government project with China. Singapore hopes that China will develop and grow well too because an unstable and backward China will cause Asia great trouble, as happened in the 1950s and 1960s. Over the last 40 years, China has reformed and opened up under Deng Xiaoping and his successors. China has been stable and prosperous and this has greatly benefited Asia and the world, including Singapore.",2016
We are happy to see China grow strong and influential in a constructive and peaceful way.¾,2016
"Therefore, we are friends with both America and with China. It is easiest to do this if the two countries are on good terms with each other and, in fact, both countries do aim to be on good terms with each other. Both believe that the Pacific is vast enough to accommodate both powers and President Xi Jinping said recently that America and China should –cultivate common circles of friends”. That is precisely what Singapore's trying to do, to be among America's circles of friends, and also among Chinaês circle of friends.¾",2016
"But life is never so straightforward. First of all, we may ourselves have some issue or other with these countries, as we did with the US when we caned Michael Fay for vandalism, and we have had issues with China too from time to time when they felt that we did not sufficiently defer to their interests. Also, sometimes the interests of our friends will conflict and we will be pressured to choose sides.",2016
"One current issue which can cause trouble is the South China Sea. It is a complicated dispute. At one level, it is a dispute among parties who claim all or some of the islands and the reefs in the South China Sea. At another level, it is about the rights of the international community, provided for under UNCLOS, The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, rights such as freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight. It is also about how international disputes and disagreements can be peacefully resolved. Now, if you do not fully understand what it is about, just remember this. This is a dispute which is very complicated because it is a dispute where even what is in dispute is itself disputed. It is true, the lawyers will tell you so. What is mine is not in dispute, what is yours is in dispute.",2016
"Singapore happens to be the country coordinator for the ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations now and this puts us in a slightly warm seat warm because each party wants us to side a bit more with them. It is not possible for us to side with everybody at once. We are doing our best to be an honest broker, dealing straight with all parties.",2016
"Now, where do all these countries stand? Let me try and give you a sense of it. China claims the –nine-dash line”. These dashes are the –nine-dash line”. There are four ASEAN countries which have overlapping claims in the South China Sea _ Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. The claims overlap with China, and with one another. The US does not have claims in the South China Sea, but they do have interests at stake because freedom of navigation and overflight are very important to them, including through the South China Sea.",2016
"Three years ago, the Philippines launched a case against China under The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. China refused to participate, but the Tribunal heard the case, and issued its award in July. The award said that China's claim to historic rights within the –nine-dash line” is incompatible with UNCLOS. China rejected the tribunal's jurisdiction and also categorically rejected the award as null and void.",2016
"What is Singapore's interest and stand? We do not have any claims of our own in the South China Sea. We are right here, very far away, even Pedra Branca is right here. We have no claims of our own. We do not take sides on other claims. China, Philippines, the other claimants. But in other ways, we do have a lot at stake and three things matter to us, international law, freedom of navigation and a united ASEAN.",2016
"Upholding international law and the peaceful settlement of disputes, is a vital interest for a small country like Singapore. When we have disputes with other countries that is how we settle them. With Malaysia, when there was a quarrel over Pedra Branca, we agreed to take it to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Singapore secured a favourable result, both sides accepted the ruling. We had another dispute with Malaysia over the development charge issue in the Points of Agreement on Railway Land. I agreed with PM Najib to submit it to arbitration. The ruling went against Singapore, but we both accepted it and we moved on. We did not let it affect our relationship with Malaysia or my personal ties with PM Najib. And that is how international disputes should be settled. However, in reality, big powers do not always act like that. Big powers can insist on their own interests and often do. They do not submit to adjudication by international tribunals, they may not comply with their rulings and China is not the only country to do this and nor is this the first time something like this has happened. Nevertheless, Singapore must support and strive for a rules-based international order. We have to depend on words and treaties. They mean everything to us. We cannot afford to have international relations work on the basis that might is right. If rules do not matter, then small countries like Singapore have no chance of survival.",2016
"Our second interest in the South China Sea is freedom of navigation. I will explain why. Take a look at the map. Singapore is this little spot down here, a little red dot. We have two vital sea lanes of communication, two arteries. One through the South China Sea, the other, through the Straits of Malacca. Ships come from Europe, the Suez Canal, they come to through the south, Straits of Malacca, pass Singapore, up the South China Sea to Japan, the Far East and vice versa. Both of these are arteries. You block one, you die; likewise with air routes. It is important to us that disputes in the South China Sea do not affect freedom of navigation or overflight by ships or aircraft.",2016
"Thirdly, Singapore needs a united and effective ASEAN. With five million people, Singaporeês voice internationally, counts for not much. But collectively, ASEAN with more than 600 million people, it can make itself heard better. This is provided ASEAN is united. On the South China Sea issue, ASEAN finds it very hard to take a common stand because the members have different interests. Some are close to China, like Laos and Cambodia. Others, like Philippines and Thailand, are treaty allies of the United States. Some are claimant states in the South China Sea, others are not. Some do not even have a coastline in the South China Sea, like Myanmar. Myanmar is not in the South China Sea. They are on the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean. ASEAN has got different interests and it is very hard to come together. But the trouble is if ASEAN cannot deal with a major issue at its doorstep affecting its members, in the long run, nobody will take ASEAN seriously and that will be very bad for all of the members of ASEAN, and for Singapore, too.",2016
"So, on the South China Sea, we have got our own stand, principled, consistent; different from Chinaês, different from the Philippines or America. Other countries will persuade us to side with them, one side or the other, and we have to choose our own place to stand, what is in our interest, calculate it, choose the spot, stand firm, we cannot succumb to pressure.¾",2016
"I tell you this so that you will understand why we do what we do and why we have to stand up for Singapore's position. Sometimes, if you read the foreign media, including the PRC media, you will find articles criticizing Singapore for not siding more with them and I know¾some Singaporeans are concerned about these criticisms because they have foreign friends. PRC friends, business partners, academic colleagues, personal contacts. They may tell you any tension between Singapore and China will affect your business, affect your collaboration. I understand these concerns. We would like business and collaboration to continue, too, to flourish between Singapore and China and Singapore and other countries because these are arrangements which benefit both sides. If they are disrupted, both sides lose. But the Government has to take a national point of view, decide what is in Singapore's overall interests. We want good relations with other countries if it is at all possible, but we must also be prepared for ups and downs from time to time.¾",2016
"Singapore has a reputation to protect, that we have our own independent, carefully-thought-out stand. We cooperate with other countries but we make our own calculations, and that is what makes us credible, consistent, reliable, valuable to others, to ASEAN partners, to the powers _ America, China Europe. It has taken us a long time to build up this reputation and we have to be very careful to maintain it.¾",2016
"Our relationship with China is much broader than the South China Sea. The friendship has lasted for decades, we have done major G-to-G projects with them. We have the Suzhou Industrial Park, the Tianjin Eco-City. If you look at the flats, it looks like HDB flats because that is where the inspiration came from. And now we have a Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI), a third government-to-government project to support China's Western region development strategy. We engage with many different provinces and cities. We are pursuing opportunities in infrastructure, in connectivity, financial services, urban planning, clean technology, working with China on One Belt, One Road, participating in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. We have many more opportunities to strengthen our friendship and cooperation with each other. That is how we do business.",2016
"Nearer home, our most important partners _ Malaysia, Indonesia. We work hard to build up all ties with them, but these are sensitive and complex relationships. From time to time, there will be differences because of their deep-seated attitudes towards us. You may have read recently one Indonesian minister declared he was not afraid of Singapore because •it is just a small countryê. It is an abang attitude towards us. It has not changed since we became independent, but we must not let these difficulties affect our broader bilateral cooperation.¾",2016
"On the whole today, our relations with Malaysia and Indonesia are good. With Malaysia, I settled the Point of Agreement on railway land with Prime Minister Najib _ 20 years of trying, finally, we succeeded and settled it. Last month, I was in Putrajaya to witness the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the High-Speed Rail between Singapore and Malaysia. PM Najib hosted us to lunch. The durian was good. The High-Speed Rail will be better. With Indonesia, I meet President Jokowi regularly, including once over nasi lemak. We want to work with Indonesia to tackle transboundary haze, to deal with the companies causing it and he has told me he is committed to solving the haze problem. We have also been discussing enhancing economic cooperation, encouraging Singapore companies to invest more in Indonesia and including to refresh our longstanding cooperation in BBK (Batam, Bintan, Karimun) in the Riau Islands just close to Singapore. Next week, on Thursday, I am having a leadersê retreat with President Jokowi.1 It is going to be in Semarang, which is in Java, Central Java. We are going there because SembCorp has a joint venture there to build an industrial park _ Kendal Industrial Park. It is the first major industrial investment by a Singapore company outside Batam. I am going to be opening it with President Jokowi and I hope that it will encourage more Singaporeans to go and to find opportunities in Indonesia.",2016
"One urgent issue where we have to cooperate with our neighbours is terrorism. It is on our minds now. Almost every day, we read of new attacks somewhere: US, Europe, the Middle East; closer to home, Indonesia and Malaysia, too. We are seeing –lone wolf” attacks by self-radicalised individuals. They go online, they get led astray, they plan something by themselves then they mount an attack, and murder innocent people. You have the truck¾rampage in Nice, the nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, and many more attacks, each one heart-breaking, shocking, yet each time no longer a real surprise. Such attacks are almost impossible to prevent completely because they are inspired by ISIS. But there is no group involved planning and executing it. So it is just one person, two persons, it is much harder for the security forces to discover and prevent these attacks.¾",2016
"The terrorist groups are active all around us in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, you have read about the arrests of Gigih Rahmat Dewa and his group in Batam. They were planning to attack Singapore, to fire a rocket to hit Marina Bay Sands from Batam. Now, speaking as a former artilleryman, I will tell you it is not so easy to fire one rocket and hit one building 20km away. Can be done, but not easy. But the trouble is if you fire one rocket at Singapore and you miss Marina Bay Sands, you may hit something else. We have to take this very seriously. Furthermore, how do you now this was the only thing he was planning and he did not have other dark thoughts on how to attack Singapore? Can you be sure that every last terrorist in the group has been arrested?",2016
"Last December, the Indonesians were expecting attacks over Christmas and New Year. They had intelligence on it. They went out of their way to pick up, arrest the groups and disrupt the attacks. They nearly succeeded. They picked up all of the groups, cleaned up all the terrorist cells, except one, and that one cell evaded the dragnet. In January, they mounted an attack in Jakarta. Fortunately, not so successful, but still a couple of people died. In Malaysia, there was a grenade attack in Puchong, near Putrajaya, in June. It was ordered by a Malaysian militant in Syria. But even long before this, the Malaysian authorities knew they had problems because they had arrested around 200 ISIS supporters, including at least 13 Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) personnel. Armed forces people, trained and pre-trained. Last month, Malaysia found that seven prison wardens had been radicalized by their detainees. You lock up a chap up, the chap subverts your jailor. The wardens had to be sent for de-radicalization. It reminded me of what happened in the 1950s when we locked up the pro-communist left-wing activists and they did the same thing. They subverted their jailors in Changi Prison. That is why we had to change the jailors and put in Gurkha guards, do not speak Chinese and so cannot be subverted. There are perhaps 1,000 Malaysians and Indonesians in the Middle East fighting with ISIS. It is enough for ISIS to form a Bahasa-speaking battalion. It is called the Katibah Nusantara, or the Archipelago Battalion, meaning the Malay Archipelago. One of the leaders is Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian. The one who ordered the Christmas and New Year attacks in Jakarta. ISIS has a magazine, Al-Fatihin, published by a media agency which is its friend, in Bahasa Indonesia. We have had to ban that magazine recently. ISIS itself puts out propaganda videos in Bahasa. It shows child fighters training with firearms. These are children of Malaysian and Indonesian fighters, and it shows the Malaysian and Indonesian fighters beheading hostages on the video so as to impress possible recruits and get more people to join them from Southeast Asia.",2016
"In Singapore, we are taking this absolutely seriously. It is not just an external threat around us, it can also be, and it is, a domestic issue because Singaporeans are not uniquely immune to jihadist propaganda. We have arrested a dozen Singaporeans who have been radicalized over the last year or two. Some have surfed jihadist websites. Some listened to extremist radio stations in our region. Some were radicalized by friends. Most were self-radicalized. Several tried to go the Middle East to join ISIS and a few succeeded and they are still there. There were a few who were prepared to mount attacks on Singapore, including one who was trying to go to Syria. And if he could not get there, he would do something here and try to kill either the President or the PM. We continue to pick up a steady trickle of such people, one or two a month, and just these last two days, you would have seen the news that the police have dealt with four Singaporeans who had been radicalized and were planning to go to Syria _ three with family connections and a fourth one with a link to Batam.",2016
"So, Gigihês plot to attack MBS is not the only definite plan by terrorists to attack targets in Singapore that we know of. We know there have been others. We have quietly acted on the information. We have taken precautions, stepped up patrols, and raised protection for major events, for prominent premises. Sometimes, we have shifted and rescheduled events because of these threats. We take it seriously. It is not certain enough to warn everybody publicly, but serious enough for us to act quietly. So, the next time you see a patrol in the city, or some extra security in some areas, maybe we are just taking precautions or doing a show of force as deterrence, but it could also be in response to a real threat that we have heard about.¾",2016
"Fortunately, we have not been attacked so far. But what happens when the terrorists get through, and an attack occurs in Singapore? If the terrorists come from abroad, I think it may be easier for us to stand together, but if the terrorist is domestic, Singaporean, one of our own, self-radicalised, like what happened in Nice, where the truck driver was a French. I think our multiracial society will come under tremendous strain. Then, how do we react?¾",2016
"There are two possible things which can happen if you look at other countries. One, people stand up, stand together, show a collective will, refuse to be cowed after an attack. People helping one another, even strangers, like what happened in Paris after the major attack last November. The Parisians stepped up to offer shelter and free taxi rides to those who were stranded. They donated blood at hospitals. Muslims and non-Muslims came together, defied the terrorists and resolved to carry on with life normally _ –we will not be cowed.” That is one reaction. But you also see another reaction _ distrust, suspicion, fear, different communities fear and blame each other, racial attacks go up. In Paris last year, you saw some of this too, mosques and Muslim shops vandalised. Muslims physically assaulted, especially women and girls wearing religious attire.¾",2016
"Then the question is: which will happen in Singapore? That answer to the question comes down to our collective resolve to stand together with one another. That, in turn, depends on how well we prepare ourselves now before an attack; prepare ourselves to build trust, to strengthen bonds, to maintain and expand our common space so that instinctively, we feel one people.¾",2016
"One big plus which Singapore has is that our religious and community leaders have taken courageous stands. They condemn terrorist attacks, they refute extremist views. They make it clear that terrorists do not represent Islam, nor do they represent Singapore Muslims. They lead by example, they guide their flocks, their communities to stand together.¾",2016
"They also understand that ours is a multi-racial society. There has to be give and take. Each community has to engage and understand each other. It must not segregate itself from other communities. We have to respect one anotherês religions, we cannot treat other groups as infidels.¾",2016
"If religious groups did the opposite, take an exclusivist approach, discourage interaction, contact with others, we will deepen our fault lines and weaken our society. Imagine, if in Singapore, only the Chinese wished each other ____; only Muslims could say Selamat Hari Raya to each another; only Indians, Hindus exchanged Deepavali greetings, and only Christians said Merry Christmas. It would be a very different, a very troubled Singapore.",2016
"It is fundamental that all religions in Singapore practise their faith in a multiracial and multi-religious context. Tolerant, give-and-take, respectful, warm. It has to be so here but it is not so in many other countries. It may be the same religion, but their practice and their teaching varies from country to country. Sometimes, these practices and teachings are exclusivist, intolerant. So, when we get foreign preachers visiting Singapore, if they do not understand our context and they want to preach these exclusivist practices and doctrines, they would cause us serious problems. So, we have to act against them and from time to time, we have acted against them. So, we have banned such preachers from coming in _ Christians some, Hindus some, Muslims also some.",2016
"Our Muslim leaders have expressed concerns to us about such Muslim preachers. I am glad they are vigilant, making sure that the Islam, preached and practised in Singapore suits our multiracial context. That is why MUIS and PERGAS have the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS), to ensure that our religious teachers and scholars are reliable guides for the community. Already, about 80 percent of our asatizahs are recognised.",2016
"We need to strengthen the ARS. I welcome the call from the Malay/Muslim community leaders yesterday to make the ARS compulsory. That means all the asatizahs must be registered under the ARS and those who are educated abroad should attend a professional development course before they get registered so that they understand our local context. I support these proposals. I commend the Malay/Muslim community because they have taken the initiative to deal with a sensitive problem. With these measures, it will ensure that all the asatizahs in Singapore understand how Islam is practised here, and how you can guide Muslims and your students to live in harmony with other Singaporeans of all races and religions.",2016
It is a very challenging landscape security-wise. The region is shifting. There are new dynamics between the powers and within ASEAN. It is going to mean a more complicated world for us. Less tranquil and we have to be more watchful. We have terrorism threatening our safety and our social fabric.¾,2016
"We have diplomats, security forces, Home Team, SAF doing good work but they by themselves alone cannot guarantee our security and safety or hold us together. Each of us have to do our part by understanding our national interests, supporting Singapore in our relations with other countries, preparing ourselves to deal with terrorism, standing together before and after an attack.¾",2016
"I am launching SG-Secure and the SG-Secure movement, in September. It is a call to action to be sensitised, trained and mobilised, for all of us to protect Singapore against an attack.¾",2016
"Ultimately, what matters most is that we must have that resolve to hold together, to fight, and to defend our place in the world.¾",2016
This brings me to the third question: –How do we make sure that we have good politics in Singapore?”,2016
We have described the strategies to progress together and to keep our place in the world.¾,2016
"But to have all these plans work, we must have good politics. If the political system malfunctions, we fail to produce good leaders, whom we trust and work with; or we cannot work together amongst ourselves and we are divided, then all our best laid plans will go to naught.",2016
"If you had followed the news, you will know about the Brexit referendum, the referendum in the United Kingdom on whether or not to stay in the EU. Brexit is short for –Britain Exit”. It is a vivid reminder of how important good politics is. In the end, the British voted to leave. It is already affecting them. The UK economy is down, Pound down, jobs moving out. But the bigger impact is on their social cohesion, fault lines in their society, between the young and old in Britain. The young want to look to Europe, the old want to stay _ –Little Britain”. Between the better educated and the working class. Between the British and the immigrants. Even among the British, between the English and the Scots. The English want to leave, the Scots want to stay. But they voted and the consequences are there.",2016
"Why did it happen? Voters lost faith, lost faith in their leaders, in their whole political class. A lot of the population felt that they were not benefitting from globalisation. London did, the provinces did not. The educated prospered, the working class did not. Immigration was a problem. ¾A lot of people came in and they felt they were not under control. In the referendum before the vote, people promised all kinds of things to work up the vote. It is easy to promise. After that, the morning after you have to pay the bill. During the campaign, you may have seen this famous campaign bus with –Vote Leave”. The bus had a big banner that said, –We send the EU 350 million pounds a week, let us fund our NHS instead. Vote Leave. Let us take back control.” Morning after the vote, after they won, 350 million pounds was struck out, became a typo, a mistake. The leaders denied it, the website wiped clean and Nigel Farage, who led the UK Independence Party, one of the leaders of –Leave”, resigned. ¾He said he had achieved his life ambition. He wanted to see UK vote to leave. Now that they had voted to leave, he is done. What follows, somebody else can look after that. Thank you very much, I am retiring. It is amusing, if it were not so tragic. But it is peopleês future, countryês future at stake, decided in campaigns like this, in the end, settled by a 52 percent of the vote.¾",2016
"These are anxieties and pressures which build up in Britain. But they are not just in Britain. Other countries too. Europe, America, even Asia.¾",2016
"Can it happen here? It could, unless we can make ourselves different.¾",2016
"How to make ourselves different? You need good leaders, you need politics which work, politics which would unite the country, and leaders who are attuned to what people want, the peopleês aspirations. You must have a sound political system and people must feel that this is theirs. They have a stake, this is mine, Singapore, and we will fight to defend it. Then, the system can work.",2016
"We have a good system today. Parliamentary, inherited from the British, amended, modified, made to work in Singapore. So, we have NCMPs, NMPs, and more diverse voices in Parliament. GRCs, multiracial politics, and many other changes, big and small.",2016
"One major change was to make the President an elected office. The President is the Head of State and the symbol of the nation. In addition, he has been given an important role: he holds the second key over reserves and appointments. Therefore instead of being chosen by Parliament, he has to be elected by the people of Singapore.¾",2016
"We have operated this two-key system for 25 years, and made many adjustments to it. But some aspects have not been revised and we need to bring them up to date.¾",2016
"In January, I appointed a Constitutional Commission, chaired by the Chief Justice, to review three things: To consider how the President can give more weight to the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA); to update the criteria for somebody to be a candidate to be President; and to make sure that minorities regularly have a chance to become President.",2016
"Last week, the Commission submitted their report to me and they made recommendations in all three areas to improve the current arrangements. We are still studying the report. We will release it soon. In principle, we accept its main recommendations. Thereafter, we will publish a White Paper on how exactly we will implement the changes, then we will table a Constitutional Amendment Bill in Parliament and when the Bill comes up for Second Reading, for the debate, we will have a full debate.",2016
"Tonight, I do not want to talk about any of the details, specific recommendations. I just want to explain the principles: why are we doing this, why are we reviewing the presidency, why we need to make changes.¾",2016
"The first one, on the Council of Presidential Advisers, is the most straightforward. When we designed the scheme, we designed it like that _ you have a President, he is elected, but he does not act alone. He is advised by a council of wise men _ the Council of Presidential Advisers. So, when he makes decisions, he will have the benefit of the experience and judgement of the CPA. We expected to improve the CPA and strengthen the CPA over time as it became more established. The arrangements have worked well and so, the changes being proposed are incremental and straightforward.",2016
The second thing we are reviewing is the qualifying criteria to become a candidate to become President.,2016
"The Presidentês job is to decide on major matters: on money, on appointments. We have built up reserves over the years. We need to make sure that the government of the day will spend within its means, and not fritter away reserves accumulated by previous generations and governments. A clean, competent public service is one of our unique strengths and enduring competitive advantages. We need to make doubly sure that people appointed to key posts are capable, upright, and will uphold our system of government. Appointments are a key thing in our Civil Service. You want to make sure that you appoint good men, you want to make sure you do not waste your money and that is why the President is there holding the second key. We need to make doubly sure that everything works.",2016
"The President who safeguards reserves and appointments must have the right experience to decide whether the Governmentês budgets and spending proposals are sound and justified. The President has to judge the character, motivation, integrity, ability of the names put up and know what advice to seek and accept.",2016
"But the President, doing that, needs to have a mandate because without a mandate, he is unable to operate the system. He has to have the experience, he has to have the judgment. He has to be able to say this is right, that is wrong, this is wise to do, that one, I think we better think over. The President who does that must have experience, must have ability, must have the right judgment to know whether the Government is telling him to do the right thing or not, to judge the Governmentês proposals, to judge the character of the people who are being put up. And, therefore, you must have qualifying criteria put down in the Constitution, to know who is qualified to be President. And the qualifying criteria are quite clear _ either you hold a senior appointment in the public service: Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, Chief Justice or you have had a senior private sector job running large, complex companies _ Singtel, DBS, Keppel, for example. In the Constitution, these are companies with paid-up capital of $100 million.",2016
"But this $100 million was set 25 years ago. It is out of date _ 25 years from then, we need to look at the number again. Look at what the President is protecting. I will share with you some numbers. When the system started in 1990, and what we are today in 2015. Our GDP in 1990 was $71 billion. Today, it is $402 billion, gone up nearly six times. Our CPF balances in 1990, was $41 billion. Today, CPF members have $300 billion of balances. Our Official Foreign Reserves has gone up from $48 billion to $351 billion, gone up seven times. Temasek Holdings, how much do you think it is worth? Net Portfolio value, $9 billion before, $266 billion now. So, the Presidentês job, protecting money, protecting reserves, those reserves have gone up, the weight of the job has increased. And the benchmark companies _ if you want to do that job _ you must be the likes of Singtel, DBS, Keppel. Those companies have also grown. But $100 million is the wrong number today. It is too small for a company to be considered, even in the same kind of responsibility as the President is doing here. In 1993, there were 158 such companies. Today, there are 2,000, but there are not 2,000 such companies which are comparable to the responsibility. So, we have got to update this benchmark, bring it up to date.¾",2016
"The President makes difficult decisions. He is not just checking numbers or adding up accounts, making sure that the accounts are properly presented. He is making economic and policy judgments. ¾If the Government says that the Budget has got a surplus, does the President believe the Government? He has to decide _ is the Government making the right judgment? If the Government says, –I want to draw money from the reserve to spend for something”, is it wise, is it justified? If a person is being proposed for a job, is he the right person? Is he suited to the responsibilities? These are real and difficult choices. The President has to make them right.¾",2016
"I give you one example. During the Global Financial Crisis, the world economy was crashing. The financial system was freezing up. Our economy was plummeting, jobs and businesses were at very serious risk. I went to Mr S R Nathan _ he was then the President _ I explained to him. I asked him for permission to draw from the reserves. How much? A lot of money. For jobs, to save businesses and jobs through Jobs Credit, $5 billion. Then we needed money to guarantee bank deposits in Singapore, a lot of bank deposits, $150 billion standing there. You may not need it, but you may need it to keep confidence in the system. We were not certain whether the plans would work, whether they would be sufficient. The President had to judge whether the Government had got it right, whether our recommendations were sound. ¾So, we briefed him, we briefed his advisers, the CPA. They listened carefully, they thought it over, and they consulted. Eventually, Mr Nathan said –yes”, he gave us permission. ¾We went ahead. We implemented the plans, turned out we did the right thing. Because of the intervention, the outlook changed, we bounced back quickly, and our jobs were safe. We even made good the reserves. In fact, we came through so smoothly, some people even did not notice we had a crisis.¾",2016
"So, it is here that the President makes critical decisions and it is here that we need the President to be competent, to be on top of the job, to be capable and that is why we need the most qualified person.¾",2016
"The third thing we need to do with the President is to safeguard, to make sure that from time to time we have a minority _ a Malay, or an Indian, or an Eurasian, or a non-Chinese _ to become the President, because this is a multi-racial society, and we became Singapore because of this fundamental reason. As Mr Lee Kuan Yew said right at the beginning, –This is not a Malay nation, not a Chinese nation, not an Indian nation. Everybody will have a place in Singapore”. The President is the Head of State, he symbolises our nation. Every Singaporean has to identify with him, everybody must know that somebody of my race has a chance to be President, and, in fact, from time to time, does become President _ Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian, or any other race.",2016
"Over 50 years, we have made a lot of progress becoming one people, regardless of race, language and religion. We had a poll recently done by CNA and IPS. It showed strong support for meritocracy. Most people believe that race does not influence success; that the interests of oneês own race should not come before the interests of other races. And everybody believes this. ¾Even the Chinese believe that Chinese should not come before others. It is the result of a lot of work over the years. We brought people together, we acknowledged our diversity. We did not pretend that race and religion doesnêt matter and we worked against the natural flow to expand our common space.",2016
"We use English as our common working language. We mixed all races together in HDB estates, so that there are no enclaves or ghettos. We implemented the Ethnic Integration Policy to prevent HDB estates from becoming re-segregated and recite the Pledge in schools every day. We also came down hard on chauvinists who try to play up racial sentiments.",2016
"Notwithstanding the progress, we are not a homogeneous society. When it comes to personal choices for example whom you marry, whom your best friends are, who your business partners are _ race still matters. The same CNA and IPS survey asked respondents, –Would you accept a particular race marrying into your family?” [To elaborate on slide] Thus it is not surprising that in elections, race is still a factor and other things being equal, a minority candidate is at a disadvantage.¾",2016
"It is the same in other multi-racial societies. In choosing the Head of State, they often consciously arrange for minorities to be appointed or elected, so that minorities feel assured of their place. Canada, an English speaking country with a large French minority, 22 percent, alternates between an English and a French speaking Governor General. New Zealand, with Asian immigrants and a Maori indigenous population, regularly appoints a non-White Governor General. The current one LTG Jerry Mateparae is a distinguished Maori, former Chief of Defence Force. His predecessor, Sir Anand Satyanand, was ethnic Indian. Switzerland has three main ethnic groups (German, French, and Italian). Swiss Germans make up two-thirds of the population. If the Swiss held elections for President, the Swiss Germans would tend to win. Instead Switzerland has a Federal Council with seven members. By an unwritten understanding, the Council includes representatives from the minority ethnic groups. The Presidency rotates annually among the Federal Council members. In all these countries, nobody questions the fitness of the Head of State, just because there is an arrangement or special effort to find one belonging to the minority group",2016
"In the US, the President is the Head of State, and is elected every four year. The US ideal is a melting pot _ many immigrant races becoming one American people. It should make no difference whether a black or a white becomes President. Yet when President Obama was elected in 2008 it was a huge thing, especially for Black Americans. After 42 White Presidents, and 143 years after the Civil War, a black man finally made it into the White House. As Michelle Obama said, –a house built by slaves”. People said Obamaês election showed that the world had changed, race didnêt matter anymore in US elections. This is completely wrong. Overall, Obama won 53 percent of the votes in 2008 against John McCain. But break down these votes by race, and you will find race mattered hugely. Whites _ 43 percent, a minority voted for Obama and Hispanics 67 percent. Blacks voted overwhelmingly for Mr Obama _ 95 percent.",2016
"In Singapore too, if we ask Singaporeans what race would you like your President to be. Each race prefers their own to be President! Most Singaporeans will accept a President of a different race, but not all. Seen in perspective, we have made great progress in becoming one people. Also glad that younger Singaporeans are more willing to accept a President of a different race than older Singaporeans. But still in an election for President, race does matter, and will matter for a long time to come.",2016
"When we created the elected President, we knew this would be an issue, but we had to address a more pressing issue then _ finding suitable candidates to stand. We did not have multiple candidates contesting a hot election, putting a good minority candidate at a disadvantage. So we decided not to make any special arrangements for minorities, and instead watch carefully how things worked out.",2016
"Over the last 25 years, we were fortunate to have had one minority elected President, Mr SR Nathan, who served with distinction for two terms. Loved by many Singaporeans, of all races. However, he was elected unopposed, both times. Today, the environment has changed. Elections are hotly contested. It will be harder for a minority candidate, however capable or qualified, to win.",2016
"Before Presidents were elected, when Parliament chose the President, we had Presidents from all races _ Encik Yusof Ishak, Dr Benjamin Sheares, Mr Devan Nair, and Mr Wee Kim Wee. Yusof Ishak was our very first President, and so far our only Malay President. If the next several Presidents are also not Malay, after some time Malay Singaporeans will start to feel uneasy, and understandably so. Likewise with Indian Singaporeans, if we do not have an Indian President for a long time after Mr Nathan. Minorities will ask: Do we have a place in Singapore? Are we truly equal? The Chinese majority may become less sensitive to the needs of other races. We will weaken the sense of shared nationhood, not just among the minorities, but for all Singaporeans. We have to do something about the problem well before that.",2016
"This problem is not easy to solve. Meritocracy and equal treatment are fundamental ideals of our society.¾They have become part of our basic mindset, including among the minorities. Some people fear that if we make an explicit arrangement to ensure a minority President from time to time, it will compromise the principle of meritocracy. The non-Chinese do not want it to appear that we have lowered standards for the sake of having a minority President.¾",2016
This makes it a delicate problem. Legally it is hard to draft and politically sensitive to explain. Psychologically it takes time to accept.,2016
"But it is a real problem, and we have to solve it. We must ensure that minorities get elected as President from time to time. We can and will make sure that all candidates for President, including minority candidates, fully meet the qualifying criteria with no compromise. Then it will be clear that when we do have a minority President, he will be as fully qualified as any other President.",2016
"This is not the first time we have introduced special provisions for minorities in our constitution. We did so with GRCs. When the idea was first floated, the minority communities had misgivings. That they did not need it, that it would be patronising and that they were quite happy with the status quo. But now after 30 years, people have come to accept GRCs. GRCs have become an important stabiliser in our system, ensuring that there will always be minority MPs in Parliament, whatever the election outcome. GRCs have also pushed politics towards the centre, favouring multi-racial parties and multi-racial policies, because all parties have to field multi-racial teams and win votes from all races.",2016
"Similarly, we need a mechanism to make sure that from time to time, we have a minority President. The Constitutional Commission has proposed a mechanism. Tonight, I am focussing only on the principle. Not how to do it, but why we need this. We want a minority Singaporean regularly to become President, to represent what we feel about Singapore, and our ideal of a multi-racial society. To follow through at the apex of our system _ the Head of State _ all the things we are doing in schools, in workplaces, through SG-Secure, to strengthen racial harmony. So that a generation from now Singaporeans of all races will feel even closer to one another.",2016
"But remember, no matter how carefully we design the elected President system, or our whole political system, there is no absolutely fool proof safety net. We will still always be on a high wire. Our politics can still go wrong. People may be elected who look good, but turn out to be unworthy. Voters may be misled to make unwise decisions through sweet talk and empty promises. Many new countries like us, and even old countries, have gone wrong.",2016
"We have been very lucky in Singapore for the last 50 years. First, very lucky that we had Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team. The people supported him, gave them a long run to set us on the right path. Second, very lucky that Mr Lee and his team were able to self-renew, stay abreast of changes, and keep peopleês support beyond the first few years, without going wrong or corrupt in office, unlike so many founding leaders of other newly independent countries. Third, even more remarkable that after Mr Lee stepped down as PM, we went through two leadership transitions. Now beyond Mr Leeês lifetime, the system is still stable, still functioning, and we continue to progress with a new generation born into a very different Singapore, with very different expectations and aspirations, yet understanding what is at stake, working closely with Government and supporting policies which will make Singapore succeed for them.",2016
"We count our blessings, but we must do our best to make sure that our political system keeps on working properly for Singaporeans. How?",2016
"Thank you for waiting for me. I gave everybody a scare. The last time I did this, I was on the parade square in SAFTI and fainted. I think that is what happened. I have never had so many doctors look at me all at once. They think I am all right, but anyway, I am going to have a full check-up after this. But before that, I would like to finish my speech. I will not go into the Elected President. There is a lot of stuff which needs to be spoken, but I will find another occasion for that. I would just like to cover two things in my speech which I think is important and which I should say tonight.¾One, to do with leadership succession and I think what happened makes it even more important that I talk about it now. Two, where do we see Singapore? Where are we today? Where will we go in the next 15 years and next 50 years? I think it is good for us to step back from our immediate preoccupations and problems, and take a longer look at where Singapore is.",2016
"But first let me talk about leadership succession. We have now got the core team for the next generation in Cabinet, but you know ministers or not, all of us are mortal. Heng Swee Keat recently gave us a bad scare, worse than what I gave you just now, much worse. I am very glad he pulled through and he is steadily covering his strength. You have seen the video of him leaving hospital. It is a miracle he's all right. The SCDF team who responded to the emergency call did an excellent job and I am glad they are here today and I should say thank you to them because I invited them here as guests and they came to treat me just now.¾",2016
"The doctors have recommended that Heng Swee Keat avoid contact with crowds for at least a few more months to minimise the risk of infection. So, he cannot do his usual community and grassroots work for a little while longer. But they have given him the go-ahead to do office work with minimum interaction. So, I have decided that Swee Keat will resume his duties as Minister for Finance. DPM Tharman will stop covering as Acting Minister. Swee Keat will focus on next year's Budget and the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE). I told him, just do the work, minimize contact which is not necessary, avoid getting an infection. It can be troublesome. Do not shake hands just do •Namasteê like that. I intend to appoint a Second Minister to help Swee Keat out with operational responsibilities at MOF and I have decided to appoint Lawrence Wong. Progressively, Swee Keat will come back to work. Building up leadership and preparing for succession is one of my top priorities. Nothing that has happened has changed my timetable or my resolve to press on with a succession. In the next GE, we will reinforce the team again and soon after the next GE, my successor must be ready to take over from me. ______ you cannot wait.¾",2016
"I am sharing my concerns and plans with you because all of us have a role to play building Singapore together. But whom are we building Singapore for? It is not just for ourselves. It is for our children, our grandchildren. It has always been the Singapore story. Every generation doing better than the one before, looking ahead, acting now, and giving the best chance possible for the next generation. What is a Singapore we are building for children? Let us give ourselves some perspective _ look back 15 years, look forward 15 years. I think plus or minus 15 years is a good timeframe. It is not so long that you cannot remember what happened before or that you cannot imagine what will come in 15 yearsê time.¾",2016
"15 years ago, we experienced 9/11. The world was in shock. Our economy went into recession. We held General Elections immediately in November 2001. We had a strong win. We went on to do many things together over the next 15 years. Just look at the changes to Singapore since then. Marina Bay, from reclaimed land, we created a whole new CBD. We built Marine Barrage, Gardens by the Bay. Now, we celebrate festivals there, including Christmas and New Year. We built beautiful HDB flats in Punggol and created the Punggol Waterway. We developed one-north to create opportunities in biomedical sciences, ICT, new media. We built buildings there with strange names, all kinds of •polisesê. Biopolis for biomedical, Mediapolis for media _ this is where MediaCorpês new office is _ Fusionopolis to bring different things together and the LaunchPad, humming with energy and innovation.¾",2016
"We built a city in the garden. The Botanic Gardens, very popular, or the East Coast Park, always full of families and life. We have got park connectors and ABC waterways all over the island, buildings with roof gardens, high-rise greenery and now, the wildlife is coming back. We have hornbills again. This one, his name is Bobby. He was born in the Istana grounds, then he went to Sungei Buloh where he collected the keys to his BTO flat. We have an otter family, famous on BBC, visiting different parts of Singapore.¾On National Day, we went back to the National Stadium and brought back the Kallang Wave. I thought you were going to join them!",2016
"In those 15 years, we went through ups and downs together. We discovered the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) group in our midst and yet we pulled together against terrorism. We experienced SARS. We were hit by the Global Financial Crisis. They did not break us. We drew closer together. Now, we are at the threshold again, looking ahead to the next phase of our nation-building. Having lived with terrorism for 15 years, we now find it a more serious threat than ever. Our economy is at a turning point. Again, like in 2001, we had a strong election win and again, we have a full agenda ahead.¾",2016
"If we put everything together that we are planning and doing, what can our children look forward to by 2030? What can we expect Singapore to look like?¾Physically, the western part of Singapore will be transformed. Lakeside Gateway will become a vibrant business district. The High-Speed Rail will connect us directly to Kuala Lumpur. This line takes a few seconds, but when the rail is ready, it will take you 90 minutes. The Jurong Lake Gardens with the Science Centre will give the Lake District a distinct identity. There will be new jobs, new high-tech manufacturing industries in the Jurong Innovation District. Another town, Tengah, will be built next door. In the north, a Woodlands regional centre, will be the northern gateway to Singapore with business spaces, housing and waterfront park. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) in Punggol will cater not just to students but to anyone wanting to upskill and we will have more start-ups to occupy incubators like Block 71.",2016
"All over the island, we will be well-connected. Eight in 10 homes will be within ten minutesê walk of a railway station. We can jog or cycle around the island along park connectors on the Round Island Route. In HDB towns, with cycling park networks like Ang Mo Kio, and others. You can cycle from home to work.¾For greenery, there will be the Rail Corridor plus parks and ABC waterways all over the island and we will have many high quality accessible preschools. If Heng Swee Keat were here and still in his old job, he would say, •Every preschool is a good preschoolê. The PSLE changes now being planned will be long past, done and with some luck, our total fertility rate would be 1.6, maybe extra luck 1.68. Huat Ah!",2016
"If you look beyond 2030 into the next 50 years, what can Singapore be? Well, that is mostly for our children to imagine and to create, but it is our duty to sketch the outlines of SG100 and launch our children into their lives and futures.¾So, what can we imagine beyond 2030? The east, eastern part of Singapore _ this is what it looks like today _ will dramatically change. Changi Airport, with T4 coming up, and T5 later, will be a shining jewel. In Paya Lebar, the Paya Lebar Airbase would have moved to Changi and the entire eastern region will be ready for us to reimagine, redevelop, rebuild. The PSA Port at Tanjong Pagar and Pasir Panjang would have gone to Tuas and become the Tuas Mega Port, boosting our trade and economy, freeing up land to be redeveloped into the Greater Southern Waterfront City. It will have 30km of waterfront that will be three times the size of Marina Bay.",2016
"There is much to look forward to and we must aim high. But the intangibles are even more important. Will we be stronger as one people? Will the Singapore Spirit grow? Will we feel more pride and togetherness as Singaporeans? That depends on how we respond to the challenges and crises that will come our way. SG50 strengthened our sense of nationhood and togetherness. We grieved together at Mr Lee Kuan Yewês passing. At the SEA Games and the Asian Para Games, we cheered Team Singapore on. At the SG50 National Day Parade, we celebrated how far we had come as One People, One Nation. After such highs, we might think, can things get any better after SG50? Can the best yet to come? The answer is a resounding •Yesê.¾",2016
"This year, we showed ourselves and showed the world what Singapore can be beyond SG50.¾We are people building on the work of each generation, looking to the future with confidence, a nation where a young Singapore boy can achieve his dream, inspired by his grand uncle, the first Olympian from Singapore, spurred by his parentsê and coachesê unwavering belief, dedicating himself to his goal, persevering through ups and downs, cheered on by the whole nation and that's how we produced an Olympic champion in Rio _ Joseph Schooling.¾",2016
"Joseph will inspire many more, younger and older, to chase their dreams, to make the impossible come true. We are a nation where every Singaporean has a place, as we saw at the NDP this year, regardless of race or religion, whether you are able-bodied, or we have special needs, we stand together with pride singing, •Count on Me, Singaporeê and signing •Count on me, Singaporeê because we know we can count on one another as we sing Majulah Singapura. With this spirit, Singapore will advance in our nation-building journey. We don't know how weêll be tested, we do not wish for tribulations to befall us, just to test our mettle, but some troubles will surely come and I am sure we won't be short of challenges. We will be tested as one people and we must not be found wanting.",2016
"Recently, somebody asked me at a dialogue, •If God appeared before you and offered you three wishes for Singapore, what you would ask for?ê I paused. I was taken aback. I thought about it and I said, if I ask for material things, we will regret it because after you have got it, you have consumed it, you have enjoyed it, you will not be satisfied, you will want more. But what I would like to have is that we be blessed with a •divine discontentê _ always not quite satisfied with what we have, always driven to do better. At the same time, we have the wisdom to count our blessings so that we know how precious Singapore is and we know how to enjoy it and to protect it. And that if we have just these two wishes fulfilled, I think that is enough because then, we can keep on keeping Singapore special and building something special in Singapore for many more years and then, we can achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation. Thank you and goodnight.",2016
"My fellow Singaporeans, good evening.",2015
"First, let us thank Kit Chan again for her beautiful singing and also for dedicating her song to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I am very glad I invited her to the rally, and I am very touched that she offered to sing ñHomeî, which is a fitting tribute to Mr Lee and a good start for the SG50 National Day Rally. Two weeks ago, on the 9th of August, we celebrated our Golden Jubilee with a parade at the Padang. For everyone who took part at the Padang, at the Floating Platform, around the Bay, watching at home or overseas, that night was something special to remember. It was not just a birthday bash, we were celebrating something far greater.",2015
"First of all, we celebrated our resolve to defend ourselves and to survive over the last 50 years. We started out at independence with only two infantry battalions in a rough neighbourhood. But our pioneers were determined to defend ourselves - we built up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Within four years, we paraded a few of our units on National Day in 1969.æ",2015
"Overhead, we had one Hunter aircraft and one Alouette helicopter flying the Singapore flag. In the mobile column, we had 18 AMX-13 tanks, which were appearing in public for the first time and Major Goh Lye Choon was a second in command. Singaporeans cheered, everyone understood what it meant and it was not just Singaporeans who took note. Fifty years later, our pioneer servicemen kicked off the SG50 vintage parade. Right marker, Colonel Swee Boon Chai - first batch, Officer Cadet School (OCS). Marching with him was Captain Hong Seng Mak, the legendary Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) - Tiger Hong. Ibrahim Bulat, who trained the first national servicemen. John Norfor and K S Rajan, our pioneer pilots. Chan Seck Sung, our first US Ranger-trained commando, still wearing a red beret.æEncik Mohd Saleh, Warrant Officer Class 1 Navy pioneer who was one of the oldest participants, 77 years young. We had Corporal Philip Ng, a citizen soldier, NSF 4 SIR 1972, NS Man 61 SIR, ten years - 1974 to 1984 - now Mindef reserve, still marching. And many others too, older, greyer but the spirit remain undaunted and I am so glad that we have some of them here with us tonight. Thank you very much. Take a bow together.",2015
"Above us, instead of one Hunter fighter, we had 20 F-16s, flying across the Padang forming the Number ñ50î. A Chinook helicopter flew the flag, escorted by two Apaches and Colonel Goh Lye Choon, now retired, was once again the Second-in-Command (2-IC) of the mobile column, this time on a Leopard tank. That is him.æBehind Lye Choon, 178 vehicles rolled past the City Hall steps. Tanks, artillery, AA missile launchers, special ops vehicles, Hazmat vehicles and completing the mobile column we had nine vehicles carrying nine families. They were the pioneers who had served in the SAF and the Home Team and they were on parade with their children who are presently serving and in two cases, with their grandchildren too. And here we have a family - grandfather, father and son. The son is Corporal (Cpl) Tajol Isfahan, 22 years old who joined the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) full-time three months ago. The father is Senior Warrant Office Mohd Azlan, whoÍs 48 years old, who is an SCDF Marine Command Specialist and their grandfather Mr Selamat, 78 years old. He joined the Singapore Fire Brigade in 1948 before I was born _ I think before most of you were born. He was involved in many major fire and rescue incidents _ the Bukit Ho Swee fire in 1961, the RobinsonÍs Department Store fire in 1972, Hotel New World in 1986. Three generations saluting the nation and we saluted them back.æ",2015
"Secondly, on National Day, we celebrated how we had turned vulnerability into strength. We started off with no hinterland and a weak economy. We depended on our entrepot trade, but our neighbours were building their own ports and sought to bypass us. Our workers were unskilled and anxious about their future but we determined to make the world our hinterland. And the tripartite partners worked together, worked hard to create the best workforce in the world. The Government, the employers and the Unions, we worked together, Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) every year ranked us number 1 in the world. And with that workforce, we made PSA and Changi, the best in the world.",2015
"We were a poor third world country; people lived in cramped and squalid slums, no modern sanitation, no utilities, but we built HDB flats to house all of us and made Singapore a first world metropolis and our beautiful home. Nearly all our water came from Johor and every now and again when an issue arose with Malaysia, some crazy politician would threaten to turn off the tap, to get us in line, but we did not die of thirst. We cleaned up our rivers, we dammed them up to become reservoirs, we built Marina Barrage and turned Marina Bay into Marina reservoir. Our whole island became a catchment area. We invented NEWater and on National Day 2002, we toasted our success. Huat Ah!",2015
"Thirdly, we celebrated our journey from third world to first as one united people. When we separated from Malaysia, we were not yet one people. Memories of the race riots were fresh and raw. The minorities were uncertain of their place in the new country. They saw what had happened in Malaysia. They wondered, will the new Singapore Government keep its promise of a multi-racial society. But 50 years on, we celebrate as one united people. On National Day, when the siren sounded, we stood and recited the Pledge together - regardless of race, language or religion. We sang Majulah Singapura.",2015
"What an exhilarating journey these 50 years have been. How did we get here?æI will put it down to three factors. Firstly, we determined to be a multi-racial society. Secondly, we created a culture _ a culture of self-reliance, and also mutual support. And thirdly, we kept faith between the Government and the people. æ",2015
"First of all, multi-racialism. We separated from Malaysia because we believed in this ideal of a multi-racial society. We believed that before race, language and religion, we should first and foremost be Singaporean. That was the fundamental reason for our foundation as a country. So we came down hard on chauvinists and racial extremists. We built HDB estates where all the different races lived and mingled together. There are no segregated ghettos in Singapore. We made English our working language and gradually all our schools shifted to teaching in English. We created Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) so that minorities would always be represented in Parliament and this way, we encouraged all the communities to come together and yet gave each community space to maintain their own cultures and their own ways of life. When delicate and awkward issues arose, we dealt with them together.æ",2015
"For example, when we discovered the Jemaah Islamiyah group, planning to set off suicide bombs in Singapore after 9/11, we handled it as one people; we did not divide into Muslims and non-Muslims. At the same, we made the effort to bring everybody together and to ensure that every community could hold his own and not be left behind. So we set up self-help groups, the communities did, starting with the Council for the Development of Singapore Malay/Muslim Community (Mendaki), later the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), then Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) and the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) and the Eurasian Association. The Government supported them and so we progressed together.",2015
"Therefore, for SG50, every community in Singapore is celebrating because every community has progressed with the nation. And each group is celebrating with the other groups because we are one united people. I have attended many SG50 celebrations this year _ a Catholic Jubilee Mass at the Indoor Stadium; the SG50 Kita National Day Observance Ceremony here in this campus, led by the Malay/ Muslim organisations but with other groups participating; a Buddhist celebration at the Indoor Stadium; a Protestant prayer event at the National Stadium; a joint concert organised by the Taoist Federation; the New Creation Church and others at the Star Performing Arts Centre. Here you see, one of the items - a Chinese Kungfu group performing with the Silat group. One function. At one dinner, I had sitting around my table representatives of all the worldÍs major religions and I posted the picture on Facebook. It showed the Rabbi of Singapore together with the Mufti of Singapore and Mr Gurmit Singh, a Sikh leader who was then chairing the IRO, the Inter-Religious Organisation. Each had different dietary rules, each was served food that met his religious requirements, but nothing stopped them from having a meal together and being friends together, in fact, they took a selfie together, which I also posted on Facebook. Only in Singapore!",2015
"Some people may think that racial and religious harmony is not a problem anymore and that I am making too much about this. But they would be wrong. Race and religion are always sensitive matters, especially for us and in some ways, today, more complex and difficult to handle than 20 years ago, because religiosity has gone up. Many societies, people are taking their religion more seriously, happens in developed countries like US, Britain, Australia, Germany where you see racial and religious tensions. Happens in Singapore too, not tensions but people taking religion more seriously and everywhere people exposed and vulnerable to extremist ideologists, like the Jihadist ideology of ISIS. We are a multi-racial and multi-religious society and we are always at risk of deep fault lines opening up, and we must never take our present happy state of affairs for granted.",2015
"The second factor of our success, after multi-racialism, is our culture of self-reliance and mutual support. We knew right from the start that to strike out and blaze a path on our own, everyone had to pull their weight and be counted, we could not afford free-riders and that is why Mr Lee Kuan Yew exhorted us over and over again to become a rugged society. We do not use that term quite so often anymore, but our people must still be robust and tough, be able to take hard knocks, always striving to be better. No one owes us a living and we have to make our own way forward in the world. But a rugged society does not mean every man for himself. We are strong even though we are small, because we are strong together. The ethos of our society is clear _ if you work hard, you should do well and that is good for you and we should cheer you and celebrate it, but at the same time if you do well, we expect you to help others and everyone has to work together so that we succeed as one team Singapore.",2015
"We have got to inculcate this ethos in our young people too.æAnd that is why we encourage our children to play sports to experience losing and winning together. That is why we send them on adventure learning and character education. To OBS, Outward Bound Singapore in Pulau Ubin and also on overseas expeditions, so that they can toughen themselves up and learn to work with one another as a team. When I was in Secondary four, my principal sent me to OBS, the experience made a deep impression on me.æNowadays, students have many more opportunities to go for adventure learning, here and also abroad. Tanjong Katong Primary School (TKPS) had a very successful programme, the Omega Challenge. It has been going on for seven years, the students who have been, have testified to how much they benefitted from it.æTragically on their recent expedition to climb Mount Kinabalu, the Omega Challenge group was caught in an earthquake. Seven students, two teachers and a guide died.æWe all mourned them and grieved with their families, we held a National Day of Remembrance.æIt will take us a long time to get over this tragedy but life goes on and it is important that we move on. And I know that the other TKPS students and teachers who were on this trip are courageously doing so. We have to go on with the adventure training, we will take the necessary safety precautions but we must keep pushing our limits to bring up a generation who will grow up tough and able to work closely together.",2015
"The third factor for our success is that we have kept faith between the Government and the people. We have built up this bond between the Government and the people over the past 50 years. The Government has kept its promises, what we said we would do, we did do. We have kept our politics honest, we insisted on high standards of integrity in public life, no corruption, no dishonesty. We are also honest when it comes to policies and when it comes to the choices that we have to make. We do not shy away from hard realities, we do not sugar-coat difficult issues. We do right by Singaporeans. In turn, our people expect the Government to perform, trust the Government to have their interests at heart and support the Government and its decisions to work for the common good. And even in tough times, we can act decisively together.",2015
"It was like this with our Pioneer Generation, for example on the issue of Land Acquisition. The Government needed land to build HDB new towns around the island to house our people. To build industrial estates like Jurong to create jobs for our people. Later on to build the MRT network to move people around. So the Government passed laws to acquire land not at the market price, without paying market prices. It was tough for the land owners who suffered financial losses, sometimes more than once. It was tough for the households who had to be resettled, lives were disrupted, thousands, maybe tens of thousands had to change their livelihoods. But if the Government had not done this, we could not have housed our population and we could not have transformed Singapore, so there were sacrifices but in the end, it was for the common good and everybody benefitted and I thank all those who sacrificed for this common good.",2015
"Even with recent times, we had to do tough things together. During SARS in 2003, we passed laws urgently on the certificate of urgency to quarantine people at home, to prevent community spread and we will ring you up and ask you to turn up on your camera to show that you are still there. Singaporeans understood this was necessary and they accepted it. Recently, South Korea had a serious outbreak of MERS but they had problems quarantining people. It was not so easy for them to get people to cooperate. There was one case, where a person was missing from her home, they knocked on the door, no answer, telephone no answer, tracked her down via her hand phone. She was several hundred kilometers away, playing golf. You can pass the laws but people have to cooperate.",2015
"From time to time, new tough issues will come up and we will need your support to deal with them. One tough issue which we already have and which will be with us for a long time to come is immigration and foreigners. It is a very sensitive matter, not an easy thing to talk about, even at the National Day Rally and Singaporeans understandably have strong views about it. The Government has heard them, we have adjusted our policies, upgraded our infrastructure, slowed down the inflow of foreign workers, tightened up on PR and citizenships applications, made sure that Singaporeans are fairly treated at work. But on foreigners and immigration, there are no easy choices. Every option has a cost, has a downside. If we close our doors to foreign workers, our economy will tank. Companies would not have enough workers. Some will close down and our own people working in these companies will lose their jobs. Also we need foreign workers to build our homes and schools, to meet our daily needs, we need foreign domestic help. So we cannot close our doors completely. On the other hand, if we let in too many foreign workers, our society will come undone. Singaporeans will be crowded out, workplaces will feel foreign, our identity will be diluted and we just cannot digest huge numbers. Therefore, we have got to find something in-between, make a right trade-off but even in-between there is a cost and there is a price and there is a pain. Companies will still find your costs going up, they will have to pass some of these costs on to consumers. Things would not be as cheap. Companies will have to pass up opportunities too. When they can see the opportunities but cannot get the workers, many companies will not be able to expand. And yet because some foreign workers will still be coming in, there will be Singaporeans who will feel that Singapore is changing too fast and will resent having to compete with non-Singaporeans. Whichever option we choose, it will involve some pain.",2015
"But I believe that I am doing what Singapore needs and what best safeguards your interest. If I did not believe that, I would not be doing it. It is my responsibility to make this decision, to make this judgement and then to act on your behalf.æAnd having acted on your behalf, to account to you for the results and for the reasons why I decided the way I did.æI think I owe it to you. You have elected me. This is my duty, I cannot shirk it.",2015
"These principles have brought us here _ multiracialism, self-reliance and mutual support, keeping faith between the government and people.æThese principles have made us special. They are not so easy to do. Easy to say, not so easy to do. Very few countries have got this right but by and large, we have got it right. And Singapore has to stay special because if we are just a dull little spot on the map, a smudge, we are going to count for nothing. We have to be a shining red dot.æIf we are soft and flabby, we are going to be eaten up. We have to be rugged and we have to have that steel in us. If we are divided, whether along racial lines or class lines, we cannot survive. We have to stand as one united people, we have to progress together.",2015
"How do we stay special?æFirst, we have to be alive to our external environment. That is a fundamental reality for a ñlittle red dotî. We will always be a small country in Southeast Asia. This is an exciting place to be, but also a rather dangerous place to live. I have not spoken much about the external affairs in recent rallies because we have been focused on domestic issues. But I think I have spoken too little because big things are happening around us and they are bound to affect us and unless we keep track of events and stay on top of developments, we may be overwhelmed. We have good relations with our neighbours, much better than 50 years ago and our neighbours have done well and we have prospered with them. But it may not always be like this. Even in the next 10 years, we cannot be sure. Certainly, in the next 50 years, nobody can rule out instability, tension, or even war in Asia.",2015
"Take Malaysia, our closest neighbour, our very close partner. We watch what is happening in Malaysia very closely. What are the Malaysians worried about? I can tell you what they are worried about. They worry about ISIS and terrorism because Malaysian citizens are becoming radicalised, going to Syria and Iraq to fight, including members of their armed forces going to become terrorists. Some have already gone, dozens are there. When they come back, they will bring back violence, the know-how and the extremist ideas. This year alone, Malaysian authorities have arrested nearly 100 citizens suspected of links with ISIS. That is one thing they worry about which we should worry about. They worry about racial and religious tensions, about society being divided along racial lines. They have had incidents recently like the riot in Low Yat Plaza, between Chinese and Malays, which have prompted soul searching. If they have racial problems, it will affect us across the border. They worry about money politics. 1MDB is in the news every day and Prime Minister Najib has just set up a national panel to develop laws on ñpolitical funding with integrityî because everybody knows this is the problem. These are MalaysiaÍs problems. Fortunately we are a different country, having separated from Malaysia 50 years ago. But our two societies and our two economies remain very closely intertwined. So their problems can easily become our problems. And if Malaysia is troubled, unstable or divided, it will affect our economy, our society and our security too. And the closer we work with them, the more we are concerned that things go well for them.",2015
"Indonesia is also important to us. It is the biggest country in Southeast Asia, it sets the tone for the whole region. When Indonesia is stable, all its neighbours benefit. If Indonesia is in a state of flux, Southeast Asia will be affected, as it was during confrontation. We have enjoyed good relations with Indonesia for many years. With President Suharto since 1970s, then with President SBY (Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono) over the last decade and now I look forward to continuing these good relations with President Jokowi. But Indonesia is a big and complex country and there are different views within Indonesia about its neighbours. And one common Indonesian view about Singapore is that we are a small neighbour enjoying undeserved success at their expense. I told you in my Chinese speech just now of one Indonesian official who explained this mindset to us but I give you another example here.",2015
"On our National Day, just recently on the 9th of August, one Indonesian newspaper published an overview of the relationship between them and us. And they quoted a senior Indonesian politician what he said about the haze. He said, ñI would only consider apologising for the haze if Singapore and Malaysia are thankful for the oxygen from Indonesian forests for 11 months each yearî. So you know where you stand and please know your place in the world. Do not get uppity. This may not reflect the Indonesian GovernmentÍs view, but we have to take note of it. It is a deep seated mindset _ that a little red dot red dot should know its place in the world _ and this mindset will not disappear for a long time. I once met a group of Indonesian journalists. We invite them to our National Day to understand us and to write about us. So they asked me, the usual questions which Indonesian journalists ask us about _ smuggling, about money laundering, about sand, about us taking advantage and so on, I gave them explanations. At the end of it all, they were persuaded, then they said to me, ñDo you feel discouraged that you keep on explaining and at the end we keep writing the same thing?î I said no, I am not discouraged at all, I am quite used to it. But I think thatÍs the fundamental reality and it is not going to change for very long time to come.",2015
"We also have to watch relations between the major powers in the region. We are friends with all the major powers, with America, with China, with Japan _ all three. And people are amazed that we can be friends with all three and they ask how this is possible? Well, we tell them just good luck but partly, itÍs also because of adroit diplomacy, because we have good officers in the MFA. But we have been lucky, we have been lucky that the big powers have been at peace with one another. And so we donÍt have to choose sides, with one against the other.",2015
"But will it be so easy to maintain this happy state of affairs in future? Will the stars always be so neatly aligned? What if relations among the powers sour and hot up? There could be a miscalculation, there could be a mishap. There could be a misunderstanding. If American and Chinese airplanes collide over the South China Sea, or Japanese and Chinese ships clash near the Diaoyu Dao or the Senkaku Islands. Then tensions will go up, countries will press us to take sides. You are either with us, or against us. Which are you? We have to decide which are we. ItÍs not so easy to decide and these are imponderables and risks which we have to be aware of and which Mr Lee Kuan Yew was very concerned that Singaporeans may not be adequately aware of and wanted to speak about, even into his extreme old age. It was that important to him. It is in fact that important to us.",2015
"We have been able to maintain our security, and our standing in the world because we have a strong SAF so others do not fool around with us. Because our economy is successful, so others find it worthwhile to cooperate with us. Because we have good diplomats and good leaders, who talk sense, command respect and can defend our interests abroad. These are important advantages for a small country which does not have aircraft carriers to go sailing around, keeping the peace and keeping ourselves safe. And we must keep these advantages to sail through the next 50 years safely. Let me just give you two examples of how having good ministers can advance our interests abroad, out of many.",2015
"Take Minister Vivian _ Vivian Balakrishnan. Minister for Environment, Water Resources.æLast year, he attended the UN Climate Change Conference which was held in Peru, in Lima in December.æVivian led the Singapore delegation but he did not just represent Singapore. He was appointed one of two Friends of the Chair. The other Friend of the Chair was Norway. And the role of the Friend of the Chair is to be an honest broker. To work behind the scenes to bridge the gaps between the different countries, to help put together a deal that countries could agree upon.æSo it is an important low-key job. They chose Vivian and Vivian was effective. Why? Because he was competent and mastered a very complicated brief. Every time he briefs Cabinet, we have to spend time reading the paper understanding the subject all over again and asking Vivian what does all these mean? But it his job to know and to explain and to analyse how we can protect our interests and not be disadvantaged. But he also was supported by a strong and cohesive team of Singapore officials. Different ministries, each knowing their job but able to work together across the ministries and take a national perspective. So they could staff him, they could work out alternatives, they could propose compromises, they could tweak the language, they can go and chat up different groups and find out what different groups are thinking. That was Team Singapore at work. They actually should wear red T-shirts at such meetings. Vivian and Team Singapore helped the Lima conference to reach a successful outcome. They had to overrun. I think they went for another 36 hours but in the end there was a positive agreement and in the process, the agreement also protected and advanced SingaporeÍs interests. ThatÍs one example.",2015
"I give you another example. These are all far away from defence. So people understand that even apart from armed forces, we have to be on our guard and know how to work with others to advance our interest. This next example is Lim Swee Say. Swee Say attends the ILO Conference in Geneva every year. International Labour Organisation. He used to go as Secretary General of NTUC, now he goes as Minister for Manpower. This year he went in June, the Director-General of ILO hosted the conference dinner, so dinner is meant to talk shop.æAnd at dinner many of the Labour Ministers shared the problems they faced in their countries, all facing similar problems _ slow job, growth youth unemployment, stagnating wages, widening income gaps.æIt was a very miserable dinner. So Swee Say is never one for a miserable dinner, he decided to turn the discussion around and to focus on solutions and not problems and he did it, the way only Swee Say knows how to do it. æHe started by acknowledging we all face the same 3 ñDî challenges, D for delta. WhatÍs D? Jobs Deficit, Skills Deficit, Quality Deficit, so three DÍs. æSo everybody nodded, say yes. Then he said, we all want the same three FÍs opportunities _ future. Jobs of the future, skills of the future, career of the future, everybody smiled. Then he concluded that the solution was to strengthen the three PÍs _ Partnership between the partners. Partners: Government, unions and employers. And he shared about SingaporeÍs unique tripartite approach and sold a little bit of ñkoyokî for us. So when Swee Say had finished, the mood in the room had lifted and everyone was discussing solutions and not moping. And the Director-General rounded the discussion and proposed three cheers for Singapore.æ",2015
"We must maintain this quality of leaders and strengthen our economy and our defence in order to hold our own with the outside world, to work with others to advance our interests and to protect ourselves when the external environment becomes troubled or hostile.æ",2015
"The next thing we must do to continue being special, is to keep on improving our education, not just in schools, but also life-long learning because education enables our people to be self-reliant, because our workers and students must stay ahead of globalisation and technology. Last year, I explained SkillsFuture, which provides Singaporeans with opportunities to develop to their full potential, whatever their starting point may be.",2015
"Since then, we have made some progress, for example, we have a SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme, it gives fresh ITE and Polytechnic graduates a head-start in their careers. They can earn a full-time salary, at the same time learn new skills and then upgrade to higher jobs. We have created the SkillsFuture Credit so every Singaporean aged 25 and above will have initially $500 of credit in the account to spend on training programmes throughout life and from time to time, we will top up that credit. Tonight, I will tell you about another thing we are doing, which has to do with SIT _ the Singapore Institute of Technology. SIT provides applied-learning pathways for students who prefer more hands-on learning. SIT awards its own degrees; it also awards degrees in collaboration with respected overseas partners. For example, TUM _ Technical University of Munich or CIA, Culinary Institute of America, it teaches you to cook, not to spy. Or DigiPen Institute of Technology, one of the top institutions for animation, computer engineering and game design. SIT is expanding its intake so it can take in more poly students, more mature students. This year, 2,000 students already, when five yearsÍ time by 2020, 3,500 students.",2015
"I visited SIT a few months ago at their campus at Dover Road.æI met their students and staff, they were keen about their future, passionate about what they were doing and the students relished the opportunities for internships to apply what they have learnt and to show off their skills. And one such student is Chen Zhangkai, who is 27. Zhangkai is a late bloomer; when he was young, he played truant, he got into fights, he was streamed into EM3, almost failed his PSLE. So he took a longer path than usual.æFrom PSLE he went to Normal Technical (stream), then to ITE, then to Nanyang Polytechnic, then to SIT. Step by step, persevering, overcoming setbacks, climbing up.æLast year, Zhangkai graduated from SIT with a Digipen degree. His final year project and portfolio were good, and a director of an animation studio came, saw it, was impressed, offered him an internship and after that offered him a job. So Zhangkai has now landed himself a dream job as an animator.æWell done Zhangkai. æSkillsFuture will produce more success stories like Zhangkai. There are always opportunities no matter where you are to upgrade and do better.",2015
"SITÍs main campus is at Dover Road with branch campuses in all the polytechnics. So we will bring all these branch campuses together and build one new centralised campus for SIT. And the new campus will be in Punggol. Across the road from SIT, we will build a creative industry cluster, in fact, on both sides of SIT. JTC will do this and bring creative industries to come to be next to SIT and to be integrated with SIT. So that students can easily go from classroom to workplace, apply what they learn. Companies can easily go to SIT and get help if they need some new ideas or some problem solved. SIT will also be integrated into Punggol Downtown, an HDB upcoming Northshore District. And the community will share SITÍs facilities; the classrooms, the workshops, the multi-purpose hall. So, we have talked about Punggol 21, we have Punggol 21 Plus with SIT, it will be Punggol 21 A-Plus. Here is how the SIT campus will look like. SIT in the middle and you can see the industry buildings on both sides, if you zoom in and take a closer look, you can see the University on one side, the industries on the other and linked bridges joining them up, so people can go back and forth. This will come.",2015
"It is a long-term effort and the Chinese saying, says:  _ ten years to grow a tree, one hundred years to nurture a person. When we go into SkillsFuture, this is our mindset. We are planting for the long term; planting seeds now to bear fruit many years from now. Of course, we also will be planting real trees on the SIT campus and when they are grown, many years now, I hope the campus will look something like this, and Punggol 21 residents will be happy.",2015
"While SkillsFuture creates more opportunities for Singaporeans, we will continue to make sure that no one is left behind. There is an African saying which says: ñIf you want to go fast, go alone.æIf you want to go far, go together.î æFor the last 50 years, we have gone together and we have gone far. That is what we must do for the next 50 years.",2015
"HDB housing is one important way we make sure that we go together. We started the HDB home ownership programme in the 1960s and it has been a tremendous success. Today, more than 90 per cent of HDB households own their flats. We are a nation of home-owners and we have achieved something unique for our people, home ownership and no ghettos or slums anywhere in Singapore. There is a true story about an IMF economist who visited Singapore, Indian economist, his name is Sudip. And he stayed at the Fairmont. Fairmount Hotel, high up, looked out saw the beautiful city, he said, ñCanÍt be. I want to find out how big this nice area around the hotel isî. So he decided he would get down, walked in one direction until he reached a not-so-nice area, turned round come back then he will know Singapore is like so many other cities in the world, with rough areas. So Sudip came down, walked and walked and walked and walked, he never reached a rough area. After two hours, he gave up and came back, astonished and impressed that Singapore had no rough area. In Boston, I did the same experiment from Harvard, half an hour, I got there. And it is not unique; every city is like that except Singapore. In Singapore, no matter where you are, you live in a good neighbourhood, you have good homes, you have parks, you have waterways, you can feel safe and secure, you can go jogging in the middle of the night, even if you are a young lady; safe. This must always be the reality for all Singaporeans.",2015
"HDB flats will always be affordable and accessible to all. In the last five years, we have made big moves in housing. We have stabilised BTO prices, we have launched 100,000 HDB flats equal to four Clementi towns. We have shortened queues for flats so most firstætimers can now choose their flat in a non-mature estate on their first try. Some of them said, ñPlease donÍt give me the flats so fast, IÍm not ready to collect my keys yet.î But we are going to do three more things in housing.First, for the higher end households, we will make more Singaporeans eligible to buy HDB flats and ECs (Executive Condominiums). Currently, there is an income ceiling for HDB flats and ECs. HDB flats _ ceiling $10,000; ECs _ ceiling $12,000. We last raised this four years ago. Since then, incomes have gone up further and also since then we have cleared the first-timer backlog, queuing up for HDB flats. So, we have the possibility now to raise the income ceiling and bring more people into the eligibility net. What shall we do? For HDB flats, we will go from $10,000 to $12,000. For ECs, we will go from $12,000 to $14,000. This way, more households can buy HDB flats and ECs.",2015
"Secondly, we will help middle and lower-income households who are buying their first home, first timers. We will make HDB flats more affordable for them. We have a complicated system of HDB grants. If you are buying a house, you know the details but the gist of it is, there are weighted towards those who earn less. So the less you earn, the more generous our grants. The more you earn, you may still be eligible for an HDB flat but I think you can pay for a bit more of it yourself. So we will enhance our grants which help the lower and middle-income households buy flats. The way we do that is we have the Special CPF Housing Grant which is called the SHG _ Special CPF Housing Grant. We will extend the SHG to cover more households. Right now, the SHG has an income ceiling, which is $6,500, and that is half of all households. And we will raise this ceiling to $8,500 so that two thirds of households will qualify for the SHG. We will also increase the amount of the SHG, because currently the maximum amount is $20,000 and we will double that to $40,000. So what does this mean? For a median household, one just about middle-income, buying a flat previously they would have received $10,000 of SHG, now they will receive $30,000 of SHG _ three times as much.",2015
"The third thing we will do is, to help those in rental flats, to help them to own their flat. With the home ownership programme, almost all Singaporeans have been able to buy their homes but there are few who still cannot afford to do that or have not been able to hold onto their flats. So, for those who have not bought the flat ever before, Minister Khaw Boon Wan recently restructured the two-room flat and the Studio apartment schemes and after the restructuring, I think that will help, it is more flexible, it will be easier for people to buy their first flat, a two-room flat. Also now that we are doubling the maximum SHG, which I just told you about, that will make two-room flats even more affordable. How much more affordable? Last time when I was an HDB agent, I told you that if you earn $1,000 a month, you can buy a two-room flat. Now with these latest changes, even if you earn below $1,000 but you are holding a stable job and you contribute to CPF regularly, you can still afford to have a two-room flat. Come to your housing agent at your MPS (Meet-the-People Session) and we will work out the details.",2015
"There is another group of rental tenants who are more difficult to help, more tricky to help and these are ones who have bought a flat before, but sold it and are now back in a rental unit. They have already benefitted from previous HDB subsidies. So the Government cannot just give them another grant to buy another flat; otherwise thereÍs no end and it would not be fair to others. So these households find it particularly difficult to afford another flat. Also these households often have many different problems _ jobs, relationships, childrenÍs education, sometimes drugs and their housing problem is a result of their other problems. ItÍs not a house being an issue but because their lives are not in order, so the house is a consequence of the mess.",2015
"I am very concerned about the future of this group because without help, they may be permanently out of reach of getting a flat of their own. æAnd they will be trapped in poverty and their children will be affected, and you perpetuate the cycle into the next generation. æ",2015
"So we have studied this problem at length. I think there is a way we can help these families to start afresh and to own their homes again. And we have got a scheme to do this which weÍll call it the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. What will a Fresh Start Housing Scheme do? It will help second-timer rental households own a two-room flat. The flat will have a shorter lease, the flat will have stricter resale conditions that can make it more affordable and also may maximise the chances of people holding on to it and not just flipping it. But itÍs not just providing a flat. ItÍs also supporting the family with counsellors, to guide them to solve their problems holistically, all aspects _ jobs, school, drugs, family relationships, planning for the future, saving for the future. The family has to play its part, and show that they are putting their lives in order, determined to get back on their feet, committed to putting their children through school. Then if they show that and with all these extra arrangements, I think we can justify providing a grant for them _ a Fresh Start Housing Grant _ to help them pay their flat. So it is not without conditions. You have to do your part. But you do your part, we help you, you have a second chance. And over time, with guidance, with help, through this Scheme you can own your own homes again. You have something to work towards, aspire to and achieve, for yourself, for your children. ItÍs a major initiative, it will take us sometime to work out but I think it is important because it shows our philosophy _ that in Singapore, we will help you but you must help yourself and we do not want anybody to be left behind.",2015
"Finally, we have to manage our population issues well. Because whether our population is young or old, growing or shrinking, that determines how our society, our outlook, our confidence will be. I will speak about two groups tonight - the seniors, and families and babies. Let me start with the seniors. The elderly will always have a place in Singapore. We honour them because they brought us here, they brought us up, and they will always have something to contribute to Singapore. That is why we made the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) to express our gratitude to the pioneers who contributed so much to building todayÍs Singapore. Having made the package, we made an extra effort: we sent PG Ambassadors to every home, to visit pioneers at home, chat with them, understand their needs and explain to them how they can personally benefit from the PGP. And in the process of talking to them, we learnt many heart-warming stories and we collected them in a nice book which we launched last month. ItÍs titled, ñTheir Past: A Present for Our Futureî. Quite a clever title; lots of interesting stories in the book. One in particular is about two friends - Mr Mutu Sammy, and Mr Ching Chong Kwi. Mr Mutu Sammy is 69 years old, Mr Ching is 81 years old. They have been neighbours and close friends for ten years. Mutu lost his leg long ago in a traffic accident. Mr Ching, who is 81 years old, takes care of Mutu - looks after his plants, changes light bulbs for him, drives him to medical check-ups. Mr Ching speaks Mandarin, Mutu speaks English, and they talk to each other in Malay. ThatÍs the Kampong spirit for you. Mutu and Mr Ching told our Ambassadors that they are very happy with the PG Package and the PG Card because Mutu benefits directly from it. There is a PG Disability Assistance Scheme and he qualifies and he gets $100 a month, and when he visits the Specialist Outpatient Clinic, the net amount he has to pay is just $12. And of course both are happy to be honoured and to be recognised. We are grateful to all our Pioneers and I think at SG50 NDR, we should say again, thank you, pioneers of Singapore.",2015
"The senior citizens, I know what you are thinking, who are not quite as old as the PG, you are also very much in our minds. So when we did the PG Package, we also did a special package of Medisave top-ups for those who are slightly younger, did not quite qualify, like me. But I think what many seniors really want is not a package but to age well. Gan Kim Yong leads the Ministerial Committee on Ageing. He will announce an Action Plan soon, which we hope will make Singapore a model for successful ageing, handling this problem. æ",2015
"Let me give you just one sneak peek from his plan tonight. Many people who are in their 60s want to work longer. They say, ñIf I sit at home and do nothing, I will go ga-ga. Furthermore, my wife will tell me to go and do something about it."" So we raised the re-employment age to 65 three years ago. And the unions and workers were very happy. I think the employers have accepted it. They are adjusting to it and starting to benefit from it. ItÍs still too early to judge but so far, it seems to be working well.",2015
"From the workersÍ point of view, 65 may be too early to stop work. Workers want us to raise the re-employment age and they want to keep working for as long as they are healthy. I hear this every time I attend a union function. I reply, ñYes, I agree fully. We will do it, we have choose a right time to do it because we want to make sure that the employers have the practical arrangements, and you can make a contribution at your company and it will not be a burden to the company.î Otherwise itÍs not sustainable. But we have been working at this problem. The tripartite partners have been discussing this and I am happy to tell you that they have reached an agreement. And the agreement is that we will pass legislation to raise the re-employment age from 65 to 67. We will do it by 2017, in other words, after the coming election.",2015
"Now, let me talk about families and babies. We discuss these as policies - what should we do, rules, incentives - but at the root of this is not policy. It is people, families and their children. Our families are what make life meaningful for many of us and our children are what will ensure that Singapore will have a future. In fact, our children are the reason why we want Singapore to have a future, for them, and so we decided on a baby Jubilee Gift for SG50 babies. And you can see some of the things down here _ A box, the strap, some T-shirts, and some other diaper holders. I am glad to hear from Grace Fu that we have given out almost 20,000 SG50 packets this year, including one to Tin Pei Ling. When I go around and see parents with the red sling, I will ask them ñAh, SG50 baby. Congratulations! How many months old?î And then, ñWhen is the next one coming?î In fact, I have been trying to find a family which has two Jubilee babies. It is possible. And finally I came across one. Introducing Charlotte on the left and Colette, on the right, twins born three weeks ago. I hope couples continue to have many babies after SG50, but I know it is a serious decision. It is hard work and a lifelong commitment. You sacrifice your time, your sleep, you have to buy milk powder, diapers, and parenting goes on for many years, well after your children have supposedly grown up. Having a child is a major responsibility, but we will help you, because every Singapore child is precious to us because each one is a member of our Singapore family. So when I speak about families at the National Day Rally, I always try to do something to make it easier for parents to have babies. Not just practical help, but also signals to change mindsets and attitudes and, therefore, encourage people gradually to change behaviour. For example, making workplaces more family friendly or getting fathers to do their share of parental duties. If you look at the numbers, last yearÍs numbers seem promising. This is the graph of the babies born every year since 2000. 2000 was a bumper year. 41,600 Dragon Year. The next Dragon Year there is a bit of a blip, but what encourages me is that this year 2014, not a Dragon Year, but almost as big as a dragon. If you look back, it is almost 10 years since we have had that many babies in one year. So it is not bad and I expect that this year, we will have about the same number as 2014. On National Day this year, we had a record number of babies born _ 129, 9th August babies.",2015
"These are statistics, but what I see directly when I go around confirms this. Because nowadays I often see families who have lots of kids and they are proud and happy that they have many children and they tell me that they have many children. On the Jubilee weekend, I met the Goh family at new Ci Yuan Hawker Centre. I went to see the hawker food, but I got a bonus I saw some babies as well. I started off noticing this SG50 baby, then I counted the sister one, brother one, another brother one two, three, four, five kids in one Goh family. Father was not there. I said whereÍs the father? Father queuing up for food. æSo talked to the father, he works in the SAF, mother is a homemaker and they are enjoying family life. æIt is good! æSo I think this is a good time to give our families and babies efforts an extra push. We will push in four ways. æ",2015
"First, we will help couples who live closer to their parents. In the old days, we used to have extended families and everybody would be under one roof. It can be complicated, but it is also a strength. Now, people live in nuclear families. But many couples still want to stay with their parents or near their parents, or parents often would want to stay with or near their married children so that the grandparents can enjoy their grandkids and the adult children can help to look after the old folks as they age. HDB already has various schemes to support this, we have relooked at the HDB incentives and we will repackage them and re-launch them more generously. And we will introduce what we call Proximity Housing Grant. What is the Proximity Housing Grant? It is for every Singaporean household whether first timer or not, you will be eligible and you can get it when you buy a resale flat with your parents or near your parents or you buy a resale flat with your married children or near your married children, you can get the Proximity Housing Grant once. But MND will work out the details and we will announce them soon.",2015
"Secondly, we will enhance the Baby Bonus. We will increase the amount of the Bonus to help cover a little bit more of the child-raising costs during the childÍs infancy and I think that will help because I hear mothers telling me that, milk powder is expensive. Well, that is so, this will be a little bit of assistance. Also, the Baby Bonus is presently just for the first four children, so we will now give it to every child. This will provide support to parents, more support to parents with larger families and also reflects our attitude that every child is valued in Singapore.",2015
"Thirdly, Medisave. In Singapore, when a new baby is born, you do not just get the birth certificate, you also get the CPF Medisave account. And the account comes with some money from the Government to help cover your MediShield premiums and vaccinations and other expenses, at least for the first few years. And this is called the Medisave grant for newborns. So we will increase the Medisave grant for newborns, we will make it enough to cover MediShield Life premiums until you are 21 years old and also help with other healthcare expenses such as recommended vaccinations. Because until 21, really the burden is on your parents. After 21, we presume you will be looking after yourself and this will give your parents greater peace of mind.",2015
"Fourthly, paternity leave. Fathers play a very important role in bringing up children. You have to do your part, if it is just the motherÍs responsibility to care for and raise your children, I think the mother will decide enough is enough. Right now, fathers get one week of paternity leave, I think fathers can do more, so we will add one more week of paternity leave, making two weeks, do not go and play golf, please use it to take care of your kid. The Government will pay for this one extra week. We will implement this, but the companies have to agree to give the leave, so we will not force the companies for a start, we will implement this on a voluntary basis to give the companies, to give employers time to adjust and then after a few years, we will look at the position again. Of course, the public service, the civil service, will volunteer straightaway. So to all the public officers who may be watching tonight, you have no excuse. The Baby Bonus, the Medisave grant and the Paternity leave changes will apply with effect from the 1st of January, the 1st of January 2015 because this is a Jubilee year, I think we should give all the JubileeÍs babies this little Hong Bao. Grace Fu will tell you lots of details soon and I hope they will all be happy details and they will help many more couples to experience the joys of parenthood.",2015
"For Singapore to continue to do well, we must have that resolve to defend this land. We must have that will to make Singapore endure and to prevail and we must stand as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion. æAfter 50 years, this faith, this sense of togetherness and purpose is stronger than before.æThe Singapore spirit ignites when we celebrate our successes together. When our athletes made us proud at the SEA Games, like Shanti Pereira who won our first sprint gold in 42 years or Ashley Liew, the marathon runner. After the other runners took a wrong turn, he slowed down and waited for them to catch up and showed sportsmanship and class.æThe Singapore spirit shines when we help one another in times of need. When we were beset by severe haze in 2013, many people came forward to distribute masks and help the less abled. When a man was run over by a truck recently, people rushed forward to push the truck, lift it up and help the man out. After a bomb exploded in Bangkok last week, Singaporeans living in Bangkok contacted the embassy to offer help.æ",2015
"Our spirit shone brightest when Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed away. Hundreds of thousands lined up, day and night to pay their respects at Parliament House and at many community tribute sites. Mr LeeÍs passing brought out so much in us. People queued patiently, they let children and seniors through, businesses provided free chairs and refreshments to those queuing up, volunteers helped out, distributing umbrellas, food, drinks and when the gun carriage carried Mr Lee on his final journey from Parliament House to the UCC, the University Cultural Centre, tens of thousands lined the streets and then it started to rain, what do we do? Everyone stayed put, it was like the 1968 National Day Parade when it poured on the parade after it had formed up. The funeral procession started on time into the pouring rain. I was deeply moved to see the crowds, stand their ground paying their last respects to Mr Lee, tear drops and raindrops fell together. For all of us, this was a historic moment shared as one Singapore family. We were mourning Mr LeeÍs passing but also affirming what he stood for and celebrating what he had achieved. That day, something changed in us. Our shared moment of sorrow bonded us. Now we do not have to struggle to find words to define the Singapore spirit or to say what being Singaporean is. Now we know that we are Singaporean.",2015
"50 years ago, our challenges seemed insurmountable. As a small country, we could easily have flickered and faded into the darkness of history. But our pioneers were made of stern stuff, they were galvanized.æMany born elsewhere but deciding to make Singapore their home and their lifelong passion. They dug in their heels and built a nation together. 50 years on, our challenges are still formidable but they are far from insurmountable. Those people who feel daunted and think SingaporeÍs best days are behind us, they are wrong. Our best days will always be ahead of us, provided we continue to have a strong team, a team of lions and the lion-hearted, leaders and the people. We have had such a good team so far, started with Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his colleagues, together with the pioneer generation, who built Singapore and made sure that Singapore would thrive beyond them. They handed over to Mr Goh Chok Tong and the second generation of Singaporeans 25 years ago now.",2015
"Our generation inherited Singapore from them and together, we took Singapore further forward to reach SG50. In the last ten years, we have written perhaps, another chapter of the Singapore story.æIf you have been following my National Day Rallies, you will know what we have done together.æ",2015
"We said we would build more beautiful homes that Singaporeans could afford, and we did. This is Punggol 21. This is the view from Dawson, I think it is taken from the air terrace, I went up to take a look, the city rejuvenated. We have continued the Kampong spirit. During Ramadan, neighbours break fast together along HDB corridors. All over the island, volunteers have beautified our shared spaces with Communities in Bloom.",2015
"We said we would strengthen our safety nets, and we did. We introduced Workfare, Silver Support, ComCare, we built new hospitals, Ng Teng Fong Hospital has opened since my last rally. Community hospitals have also opened, this is Renci and Yishun Community Hospital will soon be ready. We have made healthcare more accessible and affordable. We have CHAS, the blue card and the orange card. And we have the PG card. With MediShield Life, Singaporeans have lifelong healthcare coverage. We helped each other too, going door-to-door delivering milk powder and food to needy families. Seniors have kept active, exercising to stay fit and healthy as they age. And if you think these exercises are not quite challenging enough, you can try to do these exercises.",2015
"We said we would create more pathways for children to chase rainbows, and we did. We built Northlight and Assumption Pathway for students who failed their PSLE, because we believe in our young and we will never give up on them. We built the School of the Arts, the Sports School, the School of Science and Technology to cater to varied talents. We built first class campuses for our ITE Colleges, including ITE College Central, where we are now. We built new universities, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), UniSIM. If they were not first class institutions, Chen Long (Jackie Chan) would not have given us these beautiful old Chinese buildings to be part of SUTD. But, we are special and we will keep it so.",2015
"We said that we would transform our city, and we did. Changi Airport is upgrading, project Jewel, T4 and T5 are coming up. The Gardens by the Bay are an iconic and popular attraction. We have beautiful park connectors and ABC waterways, like Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. I took Prime Minister Tony Abbott there, the Australian PM, to show him how Singaporeans live and the natural environment that we all enjoy. I think it is worth showing off Bishan- Ang Mo Kio Park. Our volunteers have been active too, preserving nature and heritage on Pulau Ubin, keeping our rivers clean.æ",2015
"We said we would transform Marina Bay, and we did. This was Marina Bay in 2005 with Marina South still empty land and at my rally that year, I promised you that by our Jubilee year, Marina Bay would be special and this is Marina Bay today. We did this together. We had a vision, we believed in it, and together, we realised our dreams.ææ",2015
"In the last ten years, we built on what we inherited. We put brick on brick, we climbed step by step, we kept Singapore special, delivered results for Singaporeans. How did we do that? Mr Lee and his team planned beyond their terms, beyond their lifetimes. They nurtured the next generation of leaders and the next generation of Singaporeans. They taught their successors to do the same and this is what my team and I have sought to do for the last ten years. We have served you to the best of our ability, you have got to know us well, we have walked this SG50 journey together with you. My team and I take very seriously our responsibility to make sure that Singapore lasts beyond us. My core team are already in our late 50s and 60s. We will not be around forever and we must have the next team ready in the wings. The nucleus is there _ brought in at the last elections and earlier. They have taken charge of important programmes like Our Singapore Conversation, like SG50 as well as different ministries, including difficult ones. They have connected with Singaporeans young and old and participated fully in the major decisions which we have made. But we need to reinforce them, to round out the team to give Singapore the best possible chance of succeeding into the future. And that is what I need to do in the next election.",2015
"Singapore is at a turning point. We have just completed 50 successful years. Now we are starting out on our next 50 years of nationhood. Soon, I will be calling elections to ask for your mandate to take Singapore into this next phase of our nation-building. And this election will be critical. You will be deciding who is governing Singapore for the next five years; but more than that. You will be choosing the team who will be working with you for the next 15-20 years. æYou will be setting the direction for Singapore for the next 50 years. You will be determining the future for Singapore.æ",2015
"What will this future be? Will Singapore become an ordinary country, with intractable problems, slow or even negative growth; overspending; heavy burdens for our children; gridlocked government; unable to act? There are so many examples around the world. Or will Singapore always stay special for our children? A multi-racial society strengthened by diversity, not splintered by divisions. æA rugged society where everyone strives to do his best, but looks out for his fellow men, a people who live up to our song ñOne People, One Nation, One Singaporeî.æ",2015
"If you are proud of what we have achieved together, if you support what we want to do ahead, the future that we are building, then please support me, please support my team because my team and I cannot do anything just by ourselves. We have to do it with you in order to do it for you. In fact, we have to do it together in order to do it for all of us to do a good job for Singapore so that we can keep Singapore special for many years to come. Another 50 years.æ",2015
"Can I be sure that Singapore will still be doing well, still be special come SG100? æNobody can be sure. Nobody can promise that we will all live happily ever after. We all have our hopes and fears, our views and our guesses. One opinion that I know everybody would have liked to know was Mr Lee Kuan YewÍs. He is gone now, but some friends did ask him this question not too long ago.æ",2015
"In his old age, a group of friends would regularly take Mr Lee out for meals. The conversation would flow, and Mr Lee would get a chance to see a different bit of the Singapore he had built. The last time they had dinner together was in January this year, shortly before he was taken to hospital. After Mr Lee died, one of the friends wrote to me, describing what happened. Let me read her letter.",2015
"As it was the start of 2015, we talked at length about the celebrations for SG50. We took turns to encourage Mr Lee to attend as many SG50 events as possible. Actually, we hoped he would be there for the SG50 National Day Parade. Mr Lee listened to our exhortations, but stopped short of saying yes to our suggestions. At each of our gatherings, it had become a tradition to ask Mr Lee ñWill there be a Singapore many years from now?î Once, Mr Lee said ñMaybeî. On another, Mr Lee said ñYes, if there is no corruptionî.",2015
"This was classic Mr Lee _ ever-believing in Singapore, yet ever-cognisant that there was always work to be done, that we should never take things for granted. Continuing with our tradition and in the spirit of SG50, that evening we asked him ñWill there be a Singapore 50 years from now?î Mr LeeÍs answer took us all by surprise.",2015
"That evening, for the first time, Mr Lee saidñOf course there will be ƒ even better!î",2015
"Mr Lee did not make it to the SG50 NDP. But we were happy to have the three surviving ministers who signed the Separation Agreement at the Parade. Encik Othman Wok who is here with us this evening and Mr Ong Pang Boon and Mr Jek Yuen Thong. æThey sat in a place of honour, next to Mr LeeÍs chair. When we watched the video tribute to Mr Lee, we were all moved. We could sense his spirit with us, and in us. Mr Lee would have been proud of what he had built, if he had seen the NDP.æ",2015
"Now he is no longer here, we are on our own, but we are ready. Our resolve to defend ourselves is unquestioned. Our spirit and confidence is robust. Our unity and identity as a people has never been stronger. At the NDP, we showed the world what stuff Singapore is made of.æ",2015
"For me, there were two special moments in the memorable parade. One was when Kit Chan sang ñHomeî. She sang beautifully, she always does. But what most amazed me was the singing from the crowd. All round the Padang, we could hear our voices lustily singing. ñThis is home, trulyî and never before have we done that.æ",2015
"The second moment was after the parade. The last item the kids were in bright LED costumes putting on an energetic and spectacular performance. I went down to the Padang afterwards to meet them. They were in high spirits. Their faces shone with excitement and hope. I thought to myself these are the faces of the future of Singapore. 50 years from now, SG100, they will be about 60 years old _ still vigorous with many more active years ahead of them. I hope they will be back at the Padang celebrating again, remembering SG50, congratulating one and another on how much they have done and how far they have come and looking at more young, radiant faces of children and many grandchildren and singing Majulah Singapura! æThank you very much!",2015
"Singapore has come a long way. It is the work of generations, each standing on the shoulders of the one which came before and it started with one special generation Ð the Pioneer Generation (PG). And one outstanding member of the Pioneer Generation was Encik Yusof Ishak, our first President. Encik Yusof showed that in Singapore, you can rise to the top if you work hard. He stood for enduring values that underpin SingaporeÕs success Ð meritocracy, multiracialism, modernisation. He was a President for all Singaporeans. So, to mark SG50, as I said in my Malay speech, we will be honouring Encik Yusof in three ways. We are naming the new mosque in Woodlands Masjid Yusof Ishak. We are renaming the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies to ÔISEAS -- The Yusof Ishak InstituteÕ, and we are creating a ÔYusof Ishak Professorship in Social SciencesÕ in NUS.",2014
"Encik Yusof was not just a national leader, but he was also somebody you could get to know and get close to on a personal level. I first met him when I was seven years old. My family was on holiday up in Frasers Hill at Singapore House and Encik Yusof and his wife came up for a visit and brought toys for us children and I think I still remember that he gave me a little model aeroplane which would fly, powered by a rubber band, about 1959. I got to know the family better when he became Yang di-Pertuan Negara, when they stayed in the Istana grounds and I used to play with his son, Imran. In fact, it was Imran who taught me how to ride a bicycle on his bike. So several years later, when I won the PresidentÕs Scholarship, I was very honoured to receive it from Encik Yusof and we are very happy that Puan Noor Aishah is here and we are very happy that we have this opportunity to honour Encik Yusof for our 50th Anniversary.",2014
"We are grateful to pioneers like Encik Yusof who sacrificed to build Singapore. Last year, I promised to make a meaningful gesture to thank every member of the Pioneer Generation still living. I thought carefully about how we should do this and decided to focus on healthcare. So we designed the Pioneer Generation Package or the PG Package and at Chinese New Year, we held a tribute party at the Istana and recently, a fortnight ago, we had a Pioneer Generation Card Launch Party at the PeopleÕs Association (PA) headquarters and I was very happy to see many old friends and colleagues. And I was inspired by those who came, like Dr Uma Rajan, who helped start the School Health Programme and produced the original version of the ChildÕs Health Booklet, which we still use today. I think nearly all of us here must have at least one of those booklets at home, some more than one generationÕs worth of booklets.",2014
"Many other happy and heart-warming PG events all over Singapore. For example, these are the first Organising Secretaries in the PeopleÕs Association. They were the pioneer managers of our community centres in the 1960s and they were the frontline soldiers in the battle against communists and helped the Government to win the peopleÕs support. And I am happy that a few of them are here today, including my old friend, Chan Seck Sung. Welcome!",2014
"The next group are the pioneer educators at Ministry of Education (MOE) Pioneer Tribute Dinner. They taught our children, they built up our education system and this young lady is Mrs Ambiavagar. She is holding up a letter of thanks from an ex-student and she is 100 years old this year. In Teck Ghee, for our National Day Dinner, we invited 50 tables of Pioneer Generation residents and this one is the Elvis Group singing ÒItÕs Now or NeverÓ. I am not going to sing this song, but you can see beside me my Singapore General Hospital (SGH) radiographer, Mr Ng Hon Weng, leading the charge and they are all having a great time. So tonight, besides my usual guests, I have invited 50 PG seniors to represent the 450,000 PG Singaporeans. So can I invite them as well as all the other pioneers who are here tonight, please to stand up. _________Golongan Perintis silakan berdiri. Thank you. Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore.",2014
"Our pioneers were ordinary people who worked together to do extraordinary things. They overcame difficult and dangerous situations to build a sovereign, independent country. They transformed Singapore from Third World to First and they always looked to the future and strove to give their children better lives than themselves. And this is why we are commemorating SG50 next year, to celebrate the spirit of our pioneers and to commit ourselves to their enduring values as we make our way forward. I hope you will pen your hopes for the future in the ÔWishing HouseÕ at the SG50 booth later on.",2014
"Singapore is at a turning point. The world is in flux. Conflicts far away affect us. For example, in Ukraine, RussiaÕs annexation of Crimea showed us how important it is for countries to be able to defend themselves. And the recent MH17 tragedy shows us that even though Ukraine may be far away, its troubles can strike us uncomfortably close to home. It was sheer luck that there were no Singaporeans on that flight, but it could easily have been very different, and our condolences go to the families of all of the victims.",2014
"Nearer home, we see tensions in the South China Sea. The tensions are affecting sentiment in the region. It is affecting cooperation between countries. It is having an impact on confidence among businesses. It is even hardening attitudes among ordinary people towards other countries. And every foreign leader I meet asks me about the South China Sea. We are not a claimant, but we have upheld a clear position and that is to ask all the parties to exercise self-restraint in order to keep the region calm and avoid any mishaps.",2014
"There have been some positive political developments in Asia. There are new leaders, or there will be new leaders, in Indonesia and in India. Mr Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, has won the presidential elections in Indonesia and Mr Narendra Modi is the new Prime Minister in India. They enjoy strong public support, but their tasks are not easy. How their countries fare will affect the whole region, and I am looking forward to working with them and doing more with Indonesia and India.",2014
"Singapore is changing too. There is a new generation with new aspirations. There is the ageing population, which is creating new social needs. We have a better home, but we have the potential to do much, much more. Amidst these changes, Singaporeans ask ourselves, ÒHow can I improve my life? What happens to me when I get old? Where will Singapore be in the future?Ó So as I said in my National Day Rally (NDR) last year, we are taking a new way forward, each one of us giving our best, and the Government and the community doing more to support individual efforts and, together, we create a brighter future for all of us.",2014
"We have made steady progress this last year. We have stabilised the housing market, we have cleared the HDB queue. We have settled the details of MediShield Life. We are keeping paths up open through education, including opening up the Primary One (P1) admission rules this year. We are expanding our public transport network. The Bus Service Enhancement Programme, the BSEP, has improved bus services. Members of Parliament (MPs) are asking for more buses, more services. For the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network, we have just announced the Thomson-East Coast Line a couple of days ago. So this year, I will focus on three topics Ð giving our people full opportunities to achieve their potential, providing Singaporeans more assurance in retirement, and making this Singapore, a home for all ages.",2014
"Singapore must always give our people full opportunities to achieve their potential. Our pioneers showed that we can do anything, provided we set our minds to it. And we must build on their legacy and continue to give every Singaporean the confidence to shoot for the stars. Education is an important part of this and that is why every year, I speak on different aspects of education and this year, I will focus on ITE (Institute of Technical Education) and Poly(technic) students. Our ITEs and Polys are world-class. Foreign visitors are amazed by the facilities, better than many universities. Investors are impressed by the quality of the graduates Ð well-trained, can-do, productive. And our students themselves are great examples of resolve, strength and character.",2014
"People, for example, like Divesh Singaraju, who was diagnosed with lymphoma when he was ten. He recovered, led a normal life. He fell in love with aeroplanes after visiting the cockpit of a SilkAir aircraft. He qualified for Junior College (JC), but decided to enrol in Singapore Polytechnic to pursue his passion for aeronautical engineering. Unfortunately, his cancer relapsed, which delayed his studies by a year, but he recovered, went back to school, this year graduated top of his class. And while he was there, he co-founded Youth Comm to help youths with cancer. He is going on to Imperial College to study aeronautical engineering on an SIA-SINDA scholarship and I wish him every success.",2014
"Or take William Tay. William lost his hearing to illness at four. He enrolled in ITE College Central here. He joined the Photography Club and the Deaf Dragons, which is a dragon boat racing team and he graduated last year with a NITEC in Info-Communications Technology with a perfect Grade Point Average (GPA) and won the Rotary-ITE Student Excellence Award. Welcome, William. Now, he is in the Poly, studying for a Diploma in Infocomm Security Management and benefiting from the Special Needs Education Fund, and working with his lecturers to come back to his alma mater to start a sign language Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) club here in ITE College Central.",2014
"So, we have done well by our students. But our students, having done well, naturally hope to climb even higher. And I give you an example of how they feel in this striking art work entitled ÒAspirationsÓ which has been put up by ITE students in their art show and if you go outside later, you will see it on the wall somewhere outside. And it shows their desire to improve themselves to reach the top and if you look carefully, you will see also it shows the right spirit because having reached the top, you reach down and help the next person to make it too. And I would say that this is a very good picture too because it shows that there are many paths up to the top which is, in fact, my theme tonight. They are right to aim high, we want to help them to create a brighter future for themselves by many routes, not just the academic route but also alternatively by getting good jobs, mastering deep skills, performing well and then getting relevant qualifications along the way, as they work, as they advance in their careers.",2014
"Keppel Corp illustrates what we are trying to achieve. I visited KeppelÕs Offshore and Marine (O&M) Shipyard at Tuas recently and talked to their people, both their management as well as the staff. I was deeply impressed, both by what they have achieved but also by their can-do spirit and confidence. In fact, their dry dock is called the ÒFels Can-Do Dry DockÓ. So, I went back again with a video crew to interview them, myself. So, let me share with you the story of two of the Keppelites, Dorothy Han and Abu Bakar.",2014
"Dorothy graduated from ITE and joined Keppel Fels as a draftsman about 25 years ago. She left Keppel, worked elsewhere, she came back to Keppel. She rose to lead the Pipe Design Section of the Engineering Department and with an ITE certificate, she is supervising 62 people in her department. So, I asked Dorothy how she came to join Keppel and here is her interview.",2014
"Ms Han: ÒAround 20 of us were being selected and we joined Keppel and that was started off with a trainee draftsman. We just know how to draw, that is all and from there, we get to know all sorts of experience and we even climb a ship and that was my very first time.Ó",2014
PM: ÒIt must be quite tough. You must put on a hard hat?Ó,2014
"Ms Han: ÒYes, yes, for a lady and everybody was saying, you are a lady and why you have chosen so sweaty kind of job to come into a shipyard where it is very dirty and all that. But well, as what the Chinese saying and also my dad was also telling me _____.Ó",2014
"PM: ÒYou went for training courses, what did the company do?Ó",2014

"PM: ÒDiploma, with which Poly?Ó",2014
"Ms Han: ÒYes, with Ngee Ann Poly because it was in a module structure, so it was actually in five modules. So, it takes two-and-half years.Ó",2014
PM: ÒTell us the modules.Ó,2014
"Ms Han: ÒFor example, Certificates in Mechanics. Next year, I will be getting my, that is in my trade, which is Certificate in Piping System.Ó",2014
PM: ÒThat should be no problem.Ó,2014
Ms Han: ÒI hope so.Ó,2014
"PM: ÒWe are trying to encourage more girls to take up engineering and to consider careers like marine because people somehow think it is a manÕs job. So, what can I tell them, or what can you tell them to persuade them that they are mistaken, it is not just a manÕs job?Ó",2014
"Ms Han: ÒOver here, we are equal. If you can see that, if you can prove your capability, you can prove, you can take down so-called the responsibility, in fact, we are equal with all the men, yes.Ó",2014
"PM: ÒSo, you are quite confident?Ó",2014
Ms Han: ÒEverybody have the same opportunity.Ó,2014

"Abu Bakar graduated from Singapore Poly and then he joined Keppel Shipyard as an Assistant Safety Officer. Now he is working in Nakilat-Keppel Offshore and Marine, which is a joint venture shipyard Keppel did with a Qatar company in Qatar, specialising in solutions for gas carriers and offshore structures. I asked Bakar how long he had been in Qatar:",2014
PM: ÒHow long have you been there in Qatar?Ó,2014
Mr Abu Bakar: ÒI have been there close to four years.Ó,2014
PM: ÒWhat are you doing there? You are running the shipyard there?Ó,2014
Mr Abu Bakar: ÒChief Executive Officer (CEO).Ó,2014
"PM: ÒSo you are running the operation, you are in full control or you have to discuss with the Qatari Co-CEO?Ó",2014
Mr Abu Bakar: ÒWe are. There is no Co-CEO.Ó,2014
PM: ÒDid you expect to be running a shipyard in Qatar when you joined Keppel?Ó,2014
"Mr Abu Bakar: ÒNo, never.Ó",2014
"PM: ÒSo, you went on training courses along the way?Ó",2014
"Mr Abu Bakar: ÒYes, Keppel gave me a lot of training. There is a lot of management courses training that they give. Only, in fact, recently, I just went through the Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA).Ó",2014
PM: ÒWith Singapore Management University (SMU)?Ó,2014
"Mr Abu Bakar: ÒYes, SMU.Ó",2014
"PM: ÒSo, you did the EMBA, you have completed it already?Ó",2014
"Mr Abu Bakar: ÒYes, I have completed last year and it was quite a good programme, good exposure because I want to have an MBA that gives an Asian perspective as the programme itself brought you to Wharton, to China, Beijing, Hyderabad and also, of course, Singapore.Ó",2014
PM: ÒYou went into the programme; some of the other people on it must have already been graduates?Ó,2014
"Mr Abu Bakar: ÒYes, in fact, most of them.Ó",2014
PM: ÒSo did you feel you were able to cope equal with them or any difficulty because you have so many years of experience?Ó,2014
"Mr Abu Bakar: ÒYes, I think quite easy because it is quite relevant to our job in the EMBA and, in fact, to me it was very timely because you have a new company to run, because is it totally a new start-up yard. You run there, you run a new business.Ó",2014
"PM: ÒSo, you were applying in your work what you were learning on the EMBA?Ó",2014
"Mr Abu Bakar: ÒYes, that is why I said quite timely because I used the course as the platform for me to discuss my problems.Ó",2014
PM: ÒYou get free consultancy.Ó,2014
"Mr Abu Bakar: ÒThey have 30 over people to consult with. So, it was quite, very timely, seriously, very timely because that is where you ask the lecturer the real life difficulty that you have and I really appreciate that.Ó",2014
"I would like to make two points on Bakar. First, he did not have a degree, he had a Poly Diploma. The eMBA needed a degree to start. So, Keppel, Mr Choo Chiau Beng, wrote a letter to SMU vouching for BakarÕs experience and capabilities and SMU accepted that and took him in and he did well on the course. So, the employer support is very important. Secondly, Bakar is a good National Serviceman (NS) man. I first met him when he was commissioned in the old Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute (SAFTI) parade square 25 years ago on his commissioning parade and I was very happy to discover on the day I interviewed him, that was the day he was being promoted to full Colonel (NS), commanding an infantry brigade.",2014
"So, Keppelites like Dorothy and Abu Bakar can advance because Keppel O&M values every worker and the tone is set from the top over many years by leaders like Mr Choo Chiau Beng and sustained by the current Keppel leadership. So, well done, Keppel! Keppel illustrates that you can progress by acquiring deep skills and knowledge throughout your career and there are different ways to deepen your skills and knowledge, by learning on the job or by going for higher qualifications as you work, and progressively, or both. And you should look for the best ways to learn, learn what is relevant, apply that. Do not go on a paper chase for qualifications or degrees, especially if they are not relevant because pathways and opportunities to upgrade and to get better qualifications will remain open throughout your career. It is never the last chance. You always have the possibility to advance, to improve yourself, to take another step as long as you are working, as long as your mind remains fresh and active and you dare to go.",2014
"At the same time, employers must value your staff and develop them to take on higher responsibilities and with the right support at work, you can advance in your careers, whether or not you are a graduate. And this is the culture shift which we need and that is why I set up the ASPIRE (Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review) Committee chaired by Indranee Rajah to study how to create and widen and strengthen this work-and-study path. So, IndraneeÕs committee will announce its recommendations shortly, but just very broadly, we need to help students make better education and career decisions, so they know the full range of choices before they decide. We should help poly and ITE graduates get into jobs for which they were trained and have the right skills because very often, they do courses, they come up well-qualified in engineering or in building management or in design or in childcare and then, they go and do something completely which is not related.",2014
"We have to help individuals to progress and upgrade after they have graduated and started work in their careers to develop the structured career paths for them and then to implement this work and study path on a national scale. It is not easy. It involves multiple stakeholders, many government agencies -- education, manpower, trade and industry. It involves employers, companies who have to develop and value every worker and create the corporate values, the cultures, the training systems within the companies. Not easy for big companies, even harder for SMEs. We need the unions in this because you have to be fully behind the effort, championing lifelong learning like what you are doing in the Devan Nair Institute.",2014
"So, within the Government, the natural agency to take the lead in doing this is an expanded WDA, Workforce Development Agency. But the WDA will need strong support from other agencies, employers and unions. So, to bring all the pieces together, I have asked DPM Tharman to lead a tripartite committee which will involve the Government, employers and unions, to drive this and to develop an integrated system of education, training and progression for all Singaporeans and promote industry support and social recognition for individuals to advance based on their skills.",2014
"The Government, as a public service, as an employer, we will do our part. The Civil Service does offer fulfilling careers to non-graduates. For example, in the PeopleÕs Association, there is a single scheme of service, whether you are a graduate whether you are a diploma holder, you join the same scheme of service, you join at different points, but after that, your advance is based on merit and there have been many non-graduates who have progressed to senior manager positions based on their ability to do the job well.",2014
"Another area where we have many opportunities for developing these careers are in nursing. Many of our senior nurses started off without a degree, worked their way up, some of them have earned degrees along the way, but as a nurse, we assess you on your knowledge, on your ability, on your commitment and not so much on where you started. We have recently enhanced the pay and careers for the nursing profession and I hope that this will help the nurses to upgrade and progress.",2014
"The SAF, too, recognises leadership abilities, not just academic qualifications, and there are many paths upward for non-graduates and military experts and as COL (NS) BakarÕs example shows, you do not need a degree to be a good commander. So the public service can and will do more. We will put more weight on job performance and relevant skills, rather than starting qualifications. We will merge more graduate and non-graduate schemes to give everyone the same opportunities on the same career track and we will promote non-graduates more quickly to what used to be considered graduate level jobs, once they prove that they can do it.",2014
"But to succeed nationally, we need two strategic factors which will help everyone to achieve their potential. One, you must have economic growth to create opportunities for our workers to rise. Keppel can offer opportunities and create career pathways because it is a successful company. Likewise, for Singapore, our economy must be competitive too. Companies have to be able to prosper, investments must still want to come to Singapore. We must have growth in order to look after our people well. So, we have to be hard-headed in order to be good-hearted.",2014
"Secondly, and just as importantly, we need a cultural change because fundamentally, this is about our values, about how we value people, and Singapore must always be a place where everyone can feel proud of what they do, where you are respected for your contributions and your character and anyone can improve his life if he works hard and everyone can hope for a better future.",2014
"There is one more Keppelite who personifies this story and he is Roy Lim. He left school after Secondary Two. He started out working as an apprentice in Far East Levingston Shipyard which later on became Keppel FELS, and he started working 37 years ago. With support from Keppel, he completed NTC 3 and then NTC 2 and today, he is one of two shipyard managers of Keppel FELS and the two of them together manage KeppelÕs two biggest shipyards in Tuas and have 12,000 people under their charge. And Roy said, ÒI can never imagine someone like me with no education can rise to be a shipyard manager.Ó Here is my interview with him.",2014
"PM: ÒYou have been with the company all over, right, many departments and also overseas?Ó",2014
"Mr Lim: ÒOh yes, yes.Ó",2014
PM: ÒYou were in China?Ó,2014
"Mr Lim: ÒI was in China, I was in Vietnam, I was in India, I was in Holland, I was in",2014
Finland. Finland is the one that is terrible.Ó,2014
PM: ÒWhy?Ó,2014
Mr Lim: ÒBecause I am alone.Ó,2014
PM: ÒOh.Ó,2014
"Mr Lim: ÒAlright, and I have got to deal with the Russians and the Finns. I was there as a warranty engineer for the multi-purpose vessel, so I need to engage interpreters to communicate with them and I realise that thereÕs one day when I was alone in the evening, actually, I wanted to go for my dinner, so I popped into a restaurant. I popped into a restaurant and the guy chased me out. You know what he said? ÔYou are Vietnamese. You are not allowed to come inÕ. I looked at the guy, I was stunned for a while, then I gave a thought. I take out, ÔIÕm a Singaporean.Õ I take out my passport and they allowed me to go in.Ó",2014
"PM: ÒOh. So, a powerful passport.Ó",2014
"Mr Lim: ÒA powerful passport, seriously.Ó",2014
"PM: ÒSo, you didnÕt think of giving up?Ó",2014
"Mr Lim: ÒNever gave up. Later, I think about it already, then I want to give up. I have this problem, I try to solve, I canÕt solve, okay and actually, I called my wife. I said, ÔI want to give up.Õ I said itÕs very tough for me, itÕs all on my own, thereÕs no support from Singapore. If you are in Singapore, you are very comfortable because if you have any problems, you just Ôbeep, beep, beepÕ, everybody will come to attend to it.Ó",2014
"PM: ÒYes, indeed.Ó",2014
"Mr Lim: ÒSo I called my wife and said, ÔI want to give up.Õ Then my wife told me, ÔDonÕt give up. Finish the job. Even though you want to quit, finish the job and come back with your head high. So that at least you fulfil your obligation.Õ But my wife told me one thing, ÔDonÕt worry about family. Let me take care of the kids. You concentrate on your work.Õ That will actually ease me a lot of things. So, I continued to finish the job.Ó",2014
"Thank you, Roy, for being a role model and thank you, Mrs Lim, for standing by your husband through difficult times. There are many other Roy Lims and Mrs Lims in Singapore. They may not have degrees, but they are working hard and trying to improve themselves. So long as you work hard, you can always hope for a brighter future here in Singapore.",2014
"Besides creating hope for the future, we must also give assurance to those in need, especially our seniors. By and large, seniors in Singapore are doing well. Many have savings and investments. Some are happily working, others are getting good support from their children and we have good schemes to provide assurance in retirement and the CPF (Central Provident Fund) scheme and home ownership are the twin pillars of our retirement adequacy.",2014
"Home ownership is critical. The Government has worked hard to help Singaporeans own their homes. Therefore, Singapore is not just a place to live, but a home. But just as importantly, this home, your home, is a valuable nest egg when you retire. Singaporeans may not fully appreciate this, but many have significant savings in their flats. So, if you look at a typical retiree household living in a three-room flat, he has got $300,000 worth of savings in his flat. A four-room retiree household typically has $400,000 worth of savings in his flat. It is a valuable little pot of gold to draw on if they need to. That is home ownership.",2014
"The CPF has also served us well and there are three good things about the CPF. Firstly, it has personal responsibility because with the CPF scheme, the more you work, the longer you work, the more you save and the more you will have in retirement. Secondly, the CPF scheme is fair. Your savings are for your own retirement, not for someone elseÕs. Thirdly, with CPF Life, this is for life because CPF Life will pay you a stream of income as long as you live.",2014
"The CPF has been in the news recently because this year, we adjusted the minimum sum, increased it to $155,000 for those who are turning 55 this year and there were some reactions and some people say they want all of their CPF money back. Like the Chinese lady who spoke to Teo Ser Luck just now, whom I told you about just now. She wanted it back for herself, but not for her husband. But she is not the only one. Hri Kumar held a dialogue on CPF and he had one participant saying ÔGive me back my CPF. I want to spend it all.Õ So Hri Kumar, who is a very mild man, says ÒThen who will take care of you if your money runs out?Ó So the participant said, ÒGod will help me.Ó But another participant put his hand up and said, ÒWhat he means is that the Government will help himÓ.",2014
"But other people have a more balanced view. Sim Ann held a dialogue. She had a volunteer who put his hand up and pointed out how your CPF savings come about and why that was the wrong perspective and let me take you through Sim AnnÕs volunteerÕs argument. This is the CPF logo. You have all seen it, but if you look carefully, you will see that it has got three keys inside it and the three keys represent the three parties who have come together in order to make the CPF system and provide this social security for you.",2014
"Who are the three parties? One is yourself because when you work, you earn salary. From the salary, you pay your employeeÕs CPF. The second key is your employer, because the employer pays into the CPF, into your CPF, the employerÕs CPF contribution over and above your wages because the Government required them by law to do it. So the third key is Ôzheng huÕ - the Government. The Government made this system, the Government set the rules. The Government also tops up directly into the CPF of many Singaporeans. How do we do that? We give you housing grants when you buy a HDB flat. Many people will get a housing grant. We give you Medisave top-ups. When you get your GST voucher, there is a Medisave top-up in there. When the finances are good and the Minister for Finance has a good Budget, you may get the Medisave top-up. You get Workfare because if you are a low-income worker, in your Workfare, a big contribution goes automatically into your CPF every month to help you save for your retirement. So together, the three of these Ð you, your employer, your Government Ð have set up the CPF for a common purpose and that common purpose is to set up a nest egg for you for your retirement.",2014
What is this nest egg for? It is not for you to take out the whole lump sum at once. It is for you to be able to draw out a steady stream of income from the CPF in old age. It is to give you old age security.,2014
"So the question is, how much money do we need to keep in the CPF to get this income stream?Õ. And the answer is the Minimum Sum, the MS, and for the group which is turning 55 this year, the MS is $155,000. Seems like a big sum. It is far from excessive and let me show you, through an example, why I do not think that it is excessive.",2014
"Last year, I was your real estate agent. This year, the real estate market is no good, I have upgraded myself, I have become a financial planner. Okay, as a financial planner, I was sitting in my office. Mr and Mrs Tan came to consult me. They are reaching 55, they have to make decisions on their CPF and their retirement plans, so they came to ask me to talk through their options. Let me show you.",2014
"Here is Mr Tan. He is 54-plus years old. He is a senior technician and he earns $4,500 per month. His wife, Mrs Tan, is a housewife, about the same age. I did not ask the wifeÕs age, but about the same. They have two kids. The son has finished NS (National Service), going to university now. Daughter still in school. So the household income is not bad, $4,500 per month, and they are living in a four-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. You can see the flat there, I think they are on the fifth floor, fully paid-up, $450,000 worth of a flat. So this is the Tan family now.",2014
"Now, I said to Mr Tan, ÒThink about it. In ten yearsÕ time, your children will have grown up, finished studying, working, perhaps married. You will still be working, you could be on the point of retiring, but your expenses will be less in retirement, so you will not need the same income as nowÓ. So I asked Mr Tan, ÒHow much do you think you will need in retirement every month? What will we need?Ó So he thought about it.",2014
"While he thinks about it, let me ask you what you think he needs. What do you think? $3,000 per month? That is about two-thirds what he is getting now. $2,000 per month? Half, less than half what he is getting now or $1,000 per month, which is less than a quarter of the current income.",2014
"Let us have a show of hands, we decide for the Tans. Who says he needs $3,000 per month? Upstairs, nobody puts hands up. Okay, who says he needs $2,000 a month, enough? Oh, this is more. Okay, who says $1,000 enough? Old people do not spend much money. Nobody. Okay, so I take it that you think he needs about $2,000 a month, right? Which was what Mr Tan said too, after thinking it over. Now, just as well.",2014
"So let me ask you this, which is what Mr Tan asked me. To get $2,000 a month from the age of 65 for the rest of his life, how much money do you think he must put into the CPF now and lock up so that 65 years old, he can start drawing $2,000 a month? So Mr Tan did not know the answer, but I had a calculator. CPF has these things and they did the sums. So I looked up the answer and the answer is he needs $250,000 now when he is 55 years old in order to get what he wants if it is all to come from the CPF, $2,000 a month, and I do not have to tell you, but this is more than the MS, which is only $155,000.",2014
"So I told Mr Tan this. He looked a bit disappointed. He says, ÒI donÕt have $155,000.Ó So I said, ÒWell, you own a house, right?Ó He said yes. So I said the CPF lets you count your house in the MS, so the house can make up half the MS and then you only need to put in $77,500 of cash in the CPF. If you want, you can take the rest out and then you will have made up your full MS Ð half property, half cash. So he brightened up. He said, ÒAh. $75,000, no problem. I can take some money out now, go on holiday with my wife.Ó",2014
"Then I said, ÒI have not finished the sum. A quarter million, you get $2,000. $77,500, if you only leave $77,500 in the CPF, you will get out of the CPF, how much do you think? All of $600 per month. So if you need $2,000, this is not going to be enough and you have to think of some other sources of income when you reach 65.Ó So he stopped planning his holiday. He asked me, ÒSo what can I do?Ó I said, ÒWell, you have several options. First, you could continue working because ten yearsÕ time, most likely, we are working with NTUC, we should have raised the re-employment age beyond 65 and if you are still healthy, I would strongly encourage you to continue working.Ó",2014
"ÒSecondly, your children will be working and they may help to support you. I hope so because we teach them that in school. Thirdly, you can draw on your personal savings. You told me you had some POSB account savings. So that is for a rainy day and for old age. Or you can get some money out of your house.Ó",2014
"So Mr Tan says now, ÒOkay, how do I do that?Ó So, I said, ÒWell, there are several ways you can take money out of your house. You could rent out one room. You post an ad on propertyguru.com. One room in Ang Mo Kio, how much do you think? $1,000. Well, I told him conservatively, you can get $700 a month. That is per month, steady income. Or if you are going to move in with your children, your children have married, you can move in with them, you can rent out the whole flat and how much do you think can get renting out the whole flat? In fact, you can check up the answer in The Straits Times because the HDB publishes the data. Ang Mo Kio four-room flat, currently at $2,500 per month. Not bad.Ó",2014
"ÒThe third thing you could do is you could right-size. What does right-sizing mean? Right- sizing means you sell this flat, you buy a smaller flat. Let us say you buy a studio apartment, you move into the studio apartment and then in the process you can enjoy a Silver Housing Bonus from the Government which is $20,000 and if you do this, we can do the sums, you will get quite a lot of money. $210,000 plus $800 per month. $800 per month is additional income. It is on top of what CPF Life was going to pay you.Ó",2014
"So, Mr Tan says, ÒWow, it sounds good.Ó Then he got a bit carried away, he says, ÒIf I am going to live with my daughter, why donÕt I just sell my flat outright, I will get even more money?Ó So, I said, ÒWell, I encourage you to stay with your children, but I would advise you to think very, very carefully before you sell your flat because I have seen so many sad cases Ð seniors cashed out unwisely, cheated of all their money, sometimes even turfed out by their children. Quarrel with their children, quarrel with the in-laws. So, it is better if you keep your property. Even if you rent out the whole flat, it does not matter, it is yours, and you can fall back on it for your old age, just in case anything happens.Ó",2014
"So, he paused again, then he asked me a new question. He says, ÒMy neighbour, 3-room, he just turned 65, he is a bit older than me, he did a lease buyback with HDB, how does that work?Ó So, I said, ÒSorry, lease buyback not for you. Lease buyback (is for) 3-room, yours 4-room, cannot.Ó So, he says, ÒNever mind, assuming can then how?Ó So, I said ÒOkay, if you really want to know let me explain to you but remember, cannot.Ó",2014
"ÒSo, here is how it works. You bought this flat when you got married and it came with a 99-year lease, looks very long. So, this line is a 99-year lease on your flat. You have lived in it since then. Now quarter-century. In ten yearsÕ time, you will be 65 years-old and you will still have this long lease left. In fact, the long lease left is about 65 years. So, I think when you are 65, you probably are not going to live in this house for another 65 years, right?Ó So, he said, ÒOkayÓ. So, I said, Òwell, let us say you live in this house for another 30 years, then you really do not need the rest of the lease beyond that. You only need these 30 years. So, this part, you can sell to HDB and HDB will buy back from you. That is why it is called the lease buyback. And if they buy it back from you, then they will shorten your lease and then they will give you some money.Ó So, he says, ÒHow much?Ó So, we did the sums. Assuming he can get it, well, he gets $27,500 plus $900 per month and again, this is on top of what he gets from CPF. It is not quite as much cash as if he is right-sizing, but that is because he can continue to stay in the same flat and he can even rent out the room in the flat if he wants. But I said, sorry, yours is 4-room, so no lease buyback. So, Mr Tan says, ÒOh, what a pity. Can I see my MP or not to appeal for a lease buyback?Ó So, I told him Òsure, your MP, I think this is Lee Hsien Loong, Block 322 Avenue 3, and every Wednesday night at 8.00pmÓ. And that is how my advisory session ended and next thing I knew, I saw Mr Tan at my MPS.",2014
"So, actually, what Mr Tan wanted, which is to have the lease buyback for 4-room flats, many other Singaporeans also want. Last year, we held the Our Singapore Conversation and there many seniors who were living in larger flats asking for lease buyback because they felt that right-sizing, moving to a studio apartment, taking the Silver Housing Bonus, they are all attractive options, but they still preferred to grow old in the comfort of their own homes and I can fully understand that. The surroundings are familiar, your old friends are around you, your neighbours, you have known them for so long. You do not want to uproot yourself, move somewhere else unfamiliar, set up and then have to establish your networks and your links all over again. So HDB has studied this carefully and I am happy to tell you, as well as Mr and Mrs Tan if they are still watching that we will extend the Lease Buyback scheme to 4-room flats and this will cover more than half of all flat-owners in Singapore.",2014
"Now, Mr and Mrs Tan are not a real family, but the TansÕ profile is quite typical of many HDB households. And even if your own circumstances are not quite the same as the TansÕ, the general conclusion from this is still valid and what is the general conclusion from this case? First of all, the CPF and your house go hand in hand to provide for your retirement. If you have both of them, then you should have one happy couple. Secondly, the current Minimum Sum, $155,000, is not too much. Thirdly, which I think many Singaporeans do not realise, if you own a house, you only need to set aside half of the MS and that is only $77,500. Let me have a show of hands, how many of you knew all this before I explained this to you? Wow, more and more hands, but I think honestly, not all of us know and I would say even not all the MPs are completely familiar.",2014
"So, finally, if you have a house, then you have many options to get money out of the house. You can rent, you can right-size, you can (do a) lease buyback, but whichever way you go, you probably will get the lump sum and some income. So, because these are fundamental simple points, I made a summary pamphlet with Mr and Mrs Tan inside to put this all out and you can pick up your copy later after my speech.",2014
"So, the CPF scheme is good, but it can be improved. It works well for most Singaporeans but not quite for all especially the lower income and also, it is not quite flexible enough and I think we can and should improve the scheme further. First of all, we should help the lower-income Singaporeans. With the CPF and HDB for the majority of the population you can save enough for your retirement. But for a minority, 10, 20 per cent, I think even if they are working, they may not accumulate enough CPF during their working lives. Some of them may not have bought an HDB flat, some may have no family support to fall back on and in their case these individual efforts will not be enough. So, the Government and the society must help to do more, must do more to help them in their retirement. So, for this group, we should supplement their payouts from their own CPF savings with bonus payments from the Government, just the same way as we have Workfare to supplement the wages of low-income workers. So, we should have a new scheme for low-income elderly, actually, they are just poor elderly because no more income, but they are poor, they are elderly and we should call this scheme, the Silver Support Scheme.",2014
"What should the Silver Support Scheme do? We should pay a bonus every year starting from the age of 65, something extra to help the old folks with their living expenses with the cost of living. It comes from the Government, not from their own savings. It is on top of all the other Government and community support which the old people already receive and it is part of the new way forward that I spoke about last year. We are doing this, the Government is helping this group of Singaporeans, but personal responsibility remains important even while the community and the Government plays a larger role. I am not going into details today. We will announce the details at the Budget next year.",2014
"The second thing we should do with the CPF scheme is to increase flexibility, to make it more flexible. There are two views of the purpose of the CPF funds. One view is, I want to be assured of a steady stream of income in old age, but the other view is, I want a lump sum now because I need money urgently. Now, my view is that the core purpose of the CPF should still be to provide a steady stream of income in old age, but I appreciate why some CPF members want to take more money out because they have been saving up over a lifetime of work, they want to use some of these savings, they want to do something they have longed wanted to do, some lifetime ambition. They may want to go on a journey, they may want go on a haj. Or maybe they have run into some family emergency and need money to deal with the emergency.",2014
"So, after considering this for a long time and discussing it with my colleagues, I have decided I would change my view, I would adjust the policy and I think we should allow people the option to take out part of their CPF savings in a lump sum if they need to but subject to some limits. The amount which you can take out cannot be excessive. For example, it can be up to 20 per cent of the total that you have and it should only be during retirement, 65 and beyond, not Ôsuka sukaÕ, any time you need money, you visit the HDB. He is not your money lender. This is for retirement. We provide this flexibility but members must understand clearly the trade-offs because if you take out the lump sum, that means you will have less left in the CPF and your monthly payments will also be less. So, that is a second thing we should do, make the CPF more flexible, and have the possibility of a controlled lump sum withdrawal in retirement.",2014
"But there is one more outstanding issue on the CPF and that is how much should the MS be over the longer term? We have been adjusting the MS over the last ten years, the Minimum Sum, because the old number was much too low and gradually, over ten years, we have been raising it to the current $155,000 and there is one final instalment in this adjustment. Next year Ð and people have been asking what that will be Ð and I will tell you that we will decide now that for next year, the number will be $161,000 for people who are turning 55 from July 1 next year. So it is $155,000 now, it will go up a little bit up to $161,000 but if you have the property pledge, you will only need half of this and that is $80,500. It is a necessary step, but it does not change the overall picture much. Next year, if I am still a financial adviser and Mr TanÕs younger brother comes to me for advice, the sums will be more or less the same as for Mr Tan. Beyond this I do not see the need for any more major increases in the MS, but we will still need to adjust the MS from time to time because incomes will go up, so basic spending needs will increase. People are living longer and we need to provide more money for a longer retirement. Therefore, we need to build more flexibility into the CPF system and give CPF members more choices.",2014
"I have sketched a couple of key points but there are a few more important issues to consider. For example, how should we adjust the Minimum Sum beyond next year, so that members can continue to get an adequate basic retirement payout? What should be the rules and the limits for taking up the lump sum? How can members have more flexibility to invest their CPF savings, to accept more risks in the hope of higher returns? And for members who prefer payouts to rise over time, because we would like to be able to cope with future rises in the cost of living, how can we offer members options to do that because there is a trade-off? There is a finite amount of money. If you want more later on in the later years, it means that you have to have less earlier on in the earlier years and some may prefer to do that, some may prefer not to. So how can we offer members a good choice to do this? Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has worked out some possibilities, but CPF changes are very complicated. So we are going to set up an advisory panel to study all this and MOM will announce details about the panel soon.",2014
"So the CPF and home ownership provide for our needs when we retire. They are good schemes, they work well for the majority of Singaporeans, but they are not one-size-fits-all policies. They offer different choices for people in different circumstances. But we are going to improve them further so that we can better support lower-income elderly who need more help and we will make it more flexible so as to meet the needs of more Singaporeans and give you greater assurance and more options in retirement.",2014
"We want Singapore to be the best place to live, work and play. We want this to be an outstanding city, well-planned, well-run, offering a high quality of life, full of buzz and vibrancy. We want this to be our cherished home where we grow our roots, build emotional bonds and form new fond memories. We want this to be a special red dot for all Singaporeans. In the last 49 years, our physical transformation has been remarkable. Our Singaporean identity is strengthening, but keeping Singapore special is a journey without end. We will work with Singaporeans to improve on what we have.",2014
"One area where we can do better is getting all our different agencies to work more closely together, especially when their responsibilities overlap with one another or are split between different agencies and I have highlighted funny examples of inter-agency issues before. For example, it used to be if you saw a snake, then which agency to call depends on which way the snake is pointing and going. Now, there is one agency, AVA, in charge of all snakes as well as other animals.",2014
"So we have made some progress, especially after we highlight vivid examples, we have a good laugh and then we sort it out, but we have not arrived. So to prepare for this speech, I asked the MPs to give me some recent examples. So tonight, I have decided Mayor Low Yen Ling wins the lucky draw. Yen LingÕs residents had complained that the walkway to Bukit Gombak MRT Station was often dirty. One resident told her he saw a fishball stick there on the walkway. The next day, he came back, he looked, and the same fishball stick was still in the same place. Her residents have very sharp eyes. So Yen Ling called up the agencies to find out why the area was not being cleared regularly and she had to make multiple calls to several agencies, held several meetings, finally, she managed to establish what happened and here is what she found.",2014
"Listen very carefully. On the left of the walkway is a slope. The slope belongs to NEA, okay? In the middle, this is a park connector, park connector, - you think of the name, belongs to NParks. On the right-hand side is a pavement. Pavement is next to the road, road comes under LTA. So the fishball stick was on the road side and the road side was only cleared every two days because each of the organisations had their own cleaner, own schedules and they did it separately. So I do not think it makes a lot of sense and everybody has agreed and we have resolved this case. From now on, NEA Ôbao ga liaoÕ (is in charge of all three sectors).",2014
"So Yen Ling did her job as a Mayor, but she found it a frustrating and difficult experience, even though she is a Mayor. So can you imagine if you are an ordinary citizen trying to solve such a problem and running around the different agencies? So it is not the way we should be operating and we have to do better to bridge these inter-agency boundaries and to serve the public in an integrated way.",2014
"Many cities encounter these problems. Some of them have gone into ops centres to report and monitor municipal issues, like Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. They have a very modern ops centre, looks like a NASA command post and all the emergency services, all the key public agencies report to it. They have cameras all-round the city, you see the screens, they can monitor what is happening. It is manned by 50 officers and they can give commands and make things happen if there is a disaster. If there is an accident, they can divert traffic. If it rains heavily, there is a risk of landslides, because a lot of their slums live on steep hill slopes, they can sound the sirens, warn people and during the World Cup, they found this ops centre very useful.So we need to get there also and we will set up a Municipal Services Office (MSO) Ð one authority to coordinate all of the agencies: LTA, PUB, NParks, the whole lot, and single-mindedly focus on service delivery. I am going to put it in MND, but I will appoint Minister Grace Fu to oversee this Municipal Services Office, working with Minister Khaw Boon Wan. So more details will be announced later, please be patient. We are going in the right direction. We are determined to do better and I think Grace will do a good job.",2014
"While the Government will try to do a better job with the MSO, please do not make their job too difficult. Citizens also have a role to play to make this our better home. For a start, please do not drop fishball sticks and then we will not have to spend so much effort cleaning up after you. But you can also be a part of the solution, being our eyes and ears all over Singapore, and we can use technology to crowd-source, to involve Singaporeans so that you can give feedback, you can report incidents, problems on the ground and already, we have some apps to do that. For example, Ang Mo Kio Town Council, my own, has iConnect to report estate maintenance issues and residents take a picture, they send the picture in, town council deals with it and then you get a message back soon saying ÔDoneÕ or ÔBeing fixedÕ or ÔOn the wayÕ. LTA has a MyTransport app, so you can provide information on bus arrivals, parking lots, traffic jams.",2014
"NEA has a new app, myENV. I was going to demonstrate it to you, but to save time, I will just tell you about it. You should go and see, it is a very good app. It is newly-updated and it gives you information on the PSI, if there is a haze, on dengue. You can see it gives you information, PSI 51, dengue-something, water level, in case there is a flash flood somewhere and the tides and it also lets you report issues on the ground. For example, litter. Here is a report which somebody has sent in about litter and there is a photograph, you can have an address there and the status, it has been submitted. Then if you submit it, NEA will work with the agencies, resolve it and let you know once it is done.",2014
"All these apps are free. So please download them, use them, but one request, please do not send your selfies to them. This is to help us to do more with technology, with IT. In fact, I wanted to show you a lot more about technology and IT tonight. Our tech people have been doing a lot of work. There are many applications, many gadgets in our plans to make Singapore a Smart Nation - not just to run the place better, but so that it can make a difference to peopleÕs lives, to patients, to commuters, to students, to households and there are many ways we can do this. There is an exhibition outside in the auditorium. You can take a look at it later, but there is so much to cover. I have decided to put this aside so that I can do justice to the subject properly and I am going to find an opportunity later on to talk about our Smart Nation plans",2014
"But, tonight, I want to go on and talk about making this our best home and that goes beyond running our city better or using technology more because it is about making every corner of Singapore an outstanding living environment.",2014
"Last year, I talked about our plans to develop Changi, Paya Lebar, Tanjong Pagar, move the port to Tuas and these are going to happen over the next 20, 30 years. They are long-term plans, but they are acts of faith in our future. Meanwhile, we are already making our island a beautiful home. From time to time, I take a staycation in Singapore. Instead of going anywhere, I stay at home. I visit parts of Singapore which I do not get a chance to visit at work on duty and take a walk with my wife. Pretty places, interesting places, always find something interesting and once in a while, I snap a picture and share it on Facebook and let me show you some of the things:",2014
"Marina Bay - dressed up for a New Year countdown. MacRitchie - not many of you have been here. This is a treetop walk, the suspension bridge. Quite exciting. Vigorous walk, but well worth the effort. Lower Seletar Reservoir at sunset - very peaceful, good for lovers as well as other residents. Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park - very popular. You can see people on the bridge. This is the Bishan side, the Ang Mo Kio side is just as good, but I thought tonight I should show Bishan. Jurong Lake - at sunset.",2014
"Jurong used to be swamps. We filled up the swamps, built factories, transformed Jurong into an industrial town. We created jobs for Singaporeans, but we also built Jurong Lake and the Chinese Gardens and the Japanese Gardens and we have been upgrading Jurong over the years, recently as Jurong Lake District in 2008.",2014
"Jurong Lake District comes in two pieces. One piece is at Jurong Gateway, here, and one piece is the Lakeside. This one (Gateway) is commercial business, this one (Lakeside) is more residential and also greenery. The Gateway has already been transformed. I sent a drone up to take this picture - a UAV, and just to orientate you, we are looking westwards, you can see the MRT line going. This one - you can just see this is the Chinese Garden MRT station, this one is the Jurong East MRT Station. This is the Big Box. This one is the IMM for shopping. This is Westgate. This is the Devan Nair Institute, open on May Day. This one, not quite completed, is Ng Teng Fong Hospital General Hospital. It was supposed to be completed by December, but unfortunately, there are construction delays, so the opening is pushed back by about six months, but we are getting there.",2014
"So you can see that Jurong Gateway is already transformed, but there should be more to Jurong than shopping malls and industries. Jurong also includes the Lakeside, the Chinese Garden here, and the Japanese Garden here. So I visited them in June on leave. And they are very beautiful. Japanese Gardens - serene, peaceful. I think there is a marble bridge - traditional design, links you across to the Chinese side. And this is the Chinese side with pretty pavilions and pagodas. So it is very nice and yet, I felt the last time I was here was nearly 30 years ago and it looks about the same. It is also under-utilised, quite unlike Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, where there are thousands of people every day. This one - very few visitors and I felt we could do so much more with the gardens. So I asked the planners to consider bringing it all together to do a more ambitious transformation of the whole area and the planners came back to me and said, ÒYes, we have been thinking along the same lines. Here are some interesting ideas, ideas for the garden, ideas for the living environment, ideas for the surrounding towns.Ó",2014
"You know where the Japanese Garden is? You know where the Chinese Garden is? On the west side of the lake, there is Jurong Lake Gardens or Jurong Lake Park and they are really three different pieces. But if we bring them all together, we can redesign the whole area. You can change the islands, you might merge them. You can change the shape of the lake, which is right now a little bit awkward. You can create one beautiful set of gardens in our heartlands and that can be Jurong Lake Gardens and can be something really special. For example, it can be the focal point for the Community in Bloom movement. There are many Community in Bloom groups all over Singapore. Passionate, enthusiastic, they take great pride in their gardens. They beautify their neighbourhoods, they spruce up their environment, they have spice gardens downstairs, fruit gardens, flower beds and they submit outstanding entries to the Singapore Garden Festival. This one for example is a little Smurf garden, you can just see the Smurfs and there is a little Smurfette down there learning to walk. This is from previous years. But this year I have a picture - this is a winning entry from this yearÕs Garden Festival which is currently on. This entry is called ÒScent-alisingÓ - scent meaning the perfume, the aroma. And it has been put up by community groups and schools from Southeast District and it won the NParks Community in Bloom Gardens Cup Education Award this year. So, you can see the kids are thoroughly enjoying the scent garden. I am going to visit (the Singapore Garden Festival) this week after completing this NDR and I think you should go and visit the place too. But this is the sort of thing which you can do in Jurong Lake Gardens. Bring community gardeners from all over Singapore to create and look after show gardens in the Jurong Lake Gardens, make it the PeopleÕs Garden - bigger than Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park even perhaps better than Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. Next year, NParks will invite design ideas, so please give us your ideas. These are your gardens; we want to hear from you.",2014
"But Jurong Lake Gardens is not just a thing in itself. It is like Paya Lebar Airport which I told you about last year. You move Paya Lebar Airport, you not only free up Paya Lebar, you also enable development all around the eastern part of the island. So similarly with Jurong Lake Gardens if we do a good job of that and integrate it with the neighbourhood, we can transform a big part of the western part of Singapore. What are the things you can do? Well, you can connect Jurong, this by the way is Jurong East MRT Station which I showed you just now - just so you can orientate yourself. But what can you do? You can connect up the gardens to our park connector network island-wide. So that you can walk there from many places. You can connect it up to our ABC Waters Programme, up and down the Jurong River. You can have housing around the gardens. There is already housing around it, you can see the dark orange pieces - we are going to build more further north like here. Further south there are these purple bits, which are currently industrial plots. Further down near Pandan Reservoir here and the leases on the industrial plots will run out over the next 20, 30 years and as they run out we can build housing there and integrate it into the Lake District. I know those of you who are familiar with the area are thinking, Ôall these sounds good but right now there are too many traffic jamsÕ. But we are working on it, we are increasing, improving the capacity of our North-South and East-West Lines and we should see improvements in the North-South and East-West Lines over the next two years. Later on we are building the Jurong Region Line and the Cross-Island Line. So, you can see this is the Jurong Region Line which covers Jurong and the Cross-Island Line which will come all the way across here. It will take some time but it will come.",2014
"For the longer term there are even bolder possibilities. The AYE (Ayer Rajah Expressway) is now along here. It is really too close to the gardens. It constricts the gardens. If we can move the AYE down south, then you free up space next to the lake, you can build more lakeside housing. It will be like living in Bishan or Ang Mo Kio along Avenue 1 or living in Punggol along the waterway.",2014
"One day the High Speed Rail may come to Jurong. I have agreed with Prime Minister Najib to build a High Speed Rail between Singapore and KL (Kuala Lumpur). And I have told PM Najib that in Singapore why donÕt we site the terminus in the Jurong Lake District. So we are discussing with the Malaysians, we have not settled this yet but if we get a High Speed Rail terminus in the Jurong Lake District than that will make Jurong truly an exciting gateway to Singapore.",2014
"So, we can transform the whole area and the Lake Gardens will be the crown of Jurong Lake District and we will place one jewel in the crown - and that is a new Science Centre. We have got the old Science Centre somewhere down here on the east of the lake and it has entertained and educated generations of Singaporeans almost 40 years, including many adults who are kids at heart. It is still popular but just like the gardens, it is great, but I think we need to do better. So, we will build a new Science Centre and we found the right spot down here - beautiful place on the north shore near the Chinese Garden MRT Station and we flew a drone over to show you the site. This is the Chinese Garden MRT Station, this is the Chinese Garden and this piece of land, this plot is the site. So, we have got the land, we have got a blank canvas to create something unique and we can do a completely new concept for the Science Centre to take full advantage of the site and the context. We can extend out the Centre into the gardens, integrate with the living environment, build something which is fun, educational and spectacular and celebrate the ethos of our society, reflect our curiosity about the world, our spirit of scientific inquiry, our quest, restlessness to innovate and to improve and I think we will inspire and educate our young people in fun and exciting ways. It will be the ÔJewelÕ in Jurong. By 2020 or thereabouts, we will have it done.",2014
"We can do this and so much more to keep Singapore special, but what matters most is not what we build but the power of our human spirit, showing determination and resolve like our pioneers, aiming high and pushing ahead, as our young should, contributing in big ways and small to Singapore, no matter what our station in life.",2014
"In my Chinese speech I talked about the song,  - Voices from the Heart. I chanced across one vivid and moving example recently of an ordinary Singaporean who made a difference. Just before National Day, I received a email from Mr Mohamed Zulkifli, who I found out later is a senior journalist at Berita Harian and he told me that his father Mr Rahmat Yusak, had worked with Mr Lee Kuan Yew. In the early 1960s, Mr Lee had visited constituencies all over the island to rally the ground in the battle against the communists. We talked about it just now when we talked about the pioneer generation of the organising secretaries and Mr Lee went in an open top Land Rover and Mr Rahmat drove that Land Rover. You can see him here. So, Mr Zulkifli said that his father, aged 95, was very ill. In fact, Mr Rahmat passed away shortly afterwards and Mr Zulkifli wrote to me. He said, ÒMy father was only a driver but I hope people like him will not be forgotten when Singapore honours its Pioneer GenerationÓ.",2014
"Well, I remember Mr Rahmat because I used to follow my father on the visits and if you look carefully at this Land Rover, you will see there is a little finger down here and the face is hidden, but I think that is me. Mr Lee also remembered Mr Rahmat. He paid a tribute to Mr Rahmat on the 20th anniversary of the PeopleÕs Association and I quote what Mr Lee wrote then Ð ÔI cannot adequately express my abiding gratitude to all those officers who sacrificed so many weekends to accompany me on all the tours, including the cheerful driver, Rahmat Yusak. He drove that exposed Land Rover with full confidence, bringing me to all 51 constituencies. They were dedicated men. They slogged with me to help the Government win over the ground. Had the PAP lost in September 1963, the history of Singapore would have been different.Õ For his services, Mr Rahmat received the Public Service Medal (Bronze) from President Yusof Ishak.",2014
"So, I say to Mr Zulkifli, we will never forget your father, Mr Rahmat Yusak nor the many pioneers who build Singapore, including Encik Yusof Ishak, our first President, who championed enduring values that helped us to succeed. Or Madam Wong Ah Woon, who toiled for 44 years to put up so many buildings all over the island. Or Dr Uma Rajan, who kept our schoolchildren healthy. They boldly wrote the opening chapters of the Singapore Story and paved the way for their children to do better and write the rest. Because of them, we have path-breakers like Liang Wern Fook (___) and Yan Choong Lian (___) Ð enriching our lives with song and dance. Skilled professionals like Roy Lim, Abu Bakar and Dorothy Han Ð seizing opportunities, pursuing passions and realising their potential.",2014
"Now, it is our turn to give the next generation full opportunities to chase their dreams, young adults like Divesh Singaraju and William Tay Ð never giving in to adversity. Ang Kian Hua (___) and Iswandie Wanhar Ð upgrading themselves and becoming masters of their trade. Fauziah Ally and Afzal Ali Ð launching their careers and I am sure, in time, making a difference to the lives of others.",2014
"We have all contributed to the Singapore Story. At the heart of the Singapore Story is our belief in Singapore, belief that we can turn vulnerability and despair into confidence and hope; belief that out of the trauma of separation, we could build a modern metropolis and a beautiful home; belief that whatever the challenges of this uncertain world we can thrive and prosper as one united people. Let this belief and spirit burn bright in each one of us and guide us forward for the next 50 years and more. Together, let us be the pioneers of our generation. Together, let us create a brighter future for all Singaporeans.",2014
Thank you and good night.,2014
"Good evening again. I hope you have enjoyed taking a look at the campus and meeting the students here at ITE College Central. I brought the Rally to ITE for a serious purpose Ð to underscore my longstanding commitment to investing in every person, every Singaporean, to his full potential. And also to signal a change, to emphasise that this is not the usual NDR. Singapore is at a turning point. Tonight, I will talk about the challenges which we face and what we must do to change to respond to these challenges in this new phase of our development and nation-building.",2013
"Last year, I spoke about these essential elements of our future, ÒHope, Heart and HomeÓ. Since then,Êwe have been holding Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) on building a better Singapore. The OSC took a fresh approach to engage Singaporeans. They had no pre-set agenda, it was a fully open discussion and it elicited a very positive response. Nearly 50,000 people participated, and diverse groups. We had elderly residents meeting at the Yuhua Hawker Centre. Grace Fu brought them in and they had the discussion in dialects. I think they had the time of their lives and also appreciated being heard. We had the arts and the culture community expressing their point of view. We had schoolchildren drawing pictures of what they aspired to see when they grew up one day. They shared what Heart, Hope and Home meant to them.",2013
"They also expressed what they wanted to see in Singapore. First of all, opportunities - opportunities to lead fulfilling lives, to realise oneÕs potential. Secondly, purpose - coming together to build a better Singapore. Thirdly, assurance - assurance that our basic needs can be met, that we do not have to face lifeÕs uncertainties alone. Fourth, community spirit - closer community ties, stronger social cohesion, a warmer kampong spirit. And finally and fifthly, trust - trust between the Government and people, trust among Singaporeans. And these themes were summarised in the OSC exhibition which I hope you had a look at outside this auditorium. I had tea recently with the OSC Committee members, the facilitators, the volunteers, to thank them for what they were doing and I asked them what was their biggest takeaway from this exercise. They said, the spirit of openness. Participants realising that others had different, even conflicting views and that these views had to be reconciled, respected and we had to find a way forward, consensus where possible, sometimes agree to disagree. So the OSC has been a very meaningful exercise. We have listened to one another, we have created a firmer, shared basis to discuss and to plan our future and I would like to thank the OSC Committee members, the facilitators, the volunteers and the participants for all the work which they have done. Thank you very much.",2013
"To achieve our aspirations, we need to take into account the world around us. This is a time of rapid change and uncertainty. I have discussed these themes before many times, so tonight, I would just like to briefly share with you a few striking facts about technology, about globalisation, about competition and income inequalities.ÊTechnology is transforming our lives. Even tonight as I am talking to you, more than a few of you are taking pictures, tweeting, Facebooking and Instagramming in real time. But it is not just social media. We have 3D printing, a machine which can print spare parts, print models, print toys, print pistols, print body parts, organs; print things which can make a difference to our lives. Medical devices - we have been doing this research. A*STAR has a 3D printer which can print Bone Tissue Scaffolds and let me show you this picture. (Pointing to slides) This is a printer behind, this is the monitor and you can see the thing which it is printing. It looks like a little rectangle with two holes in it. Those are the Bone Tissue Scaffolds. What do you use it for? If you have a tooth extraction, after the dentist has taken a tooth out, you have a hole in your gum, you put this in, it helps the bone to grow back. And you can see this one is about to come in and on the left you can see there is one already done. A bionic person is some distance off yet but we are heading in that direction. Less spectacular but equally far-reaching are robots, Artificial Intelligence, programmes which can do smart things which previously only human beings could do. Not just placing chips on the production line but skilled, professional jobs - accounting, legal advice, radiology, reading X-rays. In the old days, each one was a professional job. You needed a lawyer, highly paid, or a doctor or an accountant. Now the basic work can be delegated to a computer programme. Liberating for us, a bit scary if you were doing that job before, but that is competition.",2013
"Competition from technology, competition also from new emerging economies - China, India, Vietnam. China and India alone have one billion workers altogether. Every year, millions of new graduates are entering the workforce. Just now in the Mandarin speech, I said seven million (per year) from China. If we add in some more from India, it is ten million a year, all hungry, looking for work. Quite formidable. One of our young professionals who took part in an OSC dialogue in Shanghai said, ÒI thought I could survive in China quite easily but I was wrongÓ. He had to scramble, but fortunately other OSC participants said that learning Mandarin in Singapore had helped them in China. They may not have enjoyed it in school or PSLE but now that they are working, they appreciated its value and they are grateful we forced them to do it. So we are seeing competition and we are seeing income inequality rising, the top zooming away, middle class stagnating. People with exceptional skills, globally in demand doing very well, not just IT or financial services, but even culture or sports.ÊTake Ronaldo, the footballer. He visited a secondary school last month, Crest Secondary School in Singapore. He got mobbed! He has many fans in Singapore. If you go to his Facebook page, 60 million Facebook fans; 20 million Twitter followers. In Chinese they say da wu jian xiao wu (_____), a little kucing kurap looking at this mega star. Therefore, spectacularly successful; but not everybody else can be as talented or as lucky as Ronaldo. So people have to work a lot harder, may not be earning a lot more but enjoying less job security than before.",2013
"So Singaporeans are affected by these global trends and feeling uncertain and anxious also because in Singapore too, technology and globalisation are widening our income gaps and in addition to that, we have domestic social stresses building. Our population is ageing, society becoming more stratified, less mobile, children of successful Singaporeans more likely to do well. Children of lower income families, fewer of them rising than in previous generations. It is a reality and we acknowledge it; we have to do our best to do something about it. These trends are compounded by day-to-day problems Ð cost of living, public transport, you know them as well as I do. So Singaporeans sense correctly that the country is at a turning point. I understand your concerns. I promise you, you will not be facing these challenges alone because we are all in this together. We will find a new way to thrive in this new environment.",2013
"My colleagues and I have been pondering these problems over the past year, thinking hard about them. What principles have worked for Singapore? What changes do we have to make, how can we continue to thrive and prosper? The OSC process and reflections have given us valuable inputs into this. They have expressed SingaporeansÕ views and feelings on where we stand and what we want Singapore to be and it has given us confidence to set out a new way forward.",2013
"We must now make a strategic shift in our approach to nation-building. Singapore has been built on three pillars - the individual, the community and the state Ð and each has played a role complementing one another. The individual working hard, saving for himself and his family. The community getting together to help different groups of people, whether it is a union, whether it is VWOs, whether it is business federations, the clans, each group coming together strengthening one another. And overall, the Government creating the conditions for a vibrant economy and for good jobs, investing heavily in our people through education, through housing, through healthcare but keeping state welfare low and targeted, stringent. Some people call this tough love but it is tough love which has worked well.",2013
"Today, the situation has changed. If we rely too heavily on the individual, their efforts alone will not be enough, especially among the vulnerable like the low-income families, like the elderly. And there are some things which individuals cannot do on their own and there are other things which we can do much better together. So we must shift the balance. The community and the Government will have to do more to support individuals. The community can and must take more initiative, organising and mobilising ourselves, solving problems, getting things done. We have to be a Òdemocracy of deeds and not a democracy of wordsÓ, as Mr S. Rajaratnam who was one of our founding fathers, said many years ago.",2013
"The Government will also do more to support individuals and the community. What we used to do we will continue to do, to provide core public services, housing, education, healthcare. But at the same timeÊwe will make three important shifts in our approach. First, we will do more to give every citizen a fair share in the nationÕs success, raise the incomes and the wealth of the low-income Singaporeans. For example, through our housing programme: home ownership.",2013
"Secondly, strengthen social safety nets. Assure people that whatever happens to you, you can get the essential social services that you need, especially healthcare.Thirdly, do more to keep paths upwards open for all; to keep our society mobile, to bring every child to a good starting point and make sure that whichever family you are born to, whether you are privileged or not privileged, you are never shut out from the system, from opportunities and especially through education.ÊThese are three strategic shifts. One, to level up people; two, to share the risks, to make sure that whatever happens in life, you will not be alone and three, to keep our system open, mobile, so that if you have talent you can rise, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We will apply these shifts progressively to all our social policies. And let me tonight talk about housing and healthcare and education specifically, add a little bit more detail, so that you understand what we are trying to do.",2013
"Singapore has succeeded because everyone has shared in the fruits of our progress. Incomes have risen across the board. The values of homes has appreciated and even poor people are not poor by any international standard. If you take the lowest one-fifth of our households by income, the lowest one-fifth, 20 per cent of households, that means about 200,000 households; each household in this group, each poor household has on average $200,000 of net wealth in the HDB flat. What does that mean? The household owns a flat, it may be fully paid, it may be not fully paid. If it is not fully paid, you subtract out the mortgage which is outstanding, what is in his name, is his. On average, $200,000 per household. No other society in the world has done that. We have achieved in Singapore growth with equity and spread the fruits of growth widely in Singapore. But today maintaining equity has become harder, because income distributions have widened. We are not all Ronaldos. But we do have a few who can do almost as well as Ronaldos and others along that spectrum. So, the Government must intervene more to keep ours a fair and a just society.",2013
"In fact we have been doing this already in recent years. It is not starting tomorrow; it has started in recent years. Workfare was a big first move. We have got permanent GST vouchers. We have got the Special Employment Credit. Each one of these schemes institutionalised, building blocks of a more active social policy. And we will build on these programmes to give those with less a better deal so long as you too make the effort, give of your best.",2013
"Housing has and will continue to be an important way to share the fruits of our progress with all Singaporeans and to level up the poor. The HDB programme is not just about the roof over our heads. It is also a valuable nest egg. But it is not just a valuable nest egg. It is also a home, a home where we sink roots, where we raise families, where we build ties, friendships, emotional ties with our fellow Singaporeans. And you can see this in any community anywhere in Singapore.ÊBut I give you as an example, my Teck Ghee residents. Look at this gentleman, Mr Ho Tee Soon. He was a sailor all his life. He came back to Ang Mo Kio, settled down in 1978, and raised his family there. Four children, nine grandchildren, now he even has six great-grandchildren. He has got friends, he has got family, he has got neighbours, he chit-chats with his friends on his void deck daily. And take a guess, how old he is? He is 104! Or take Madam Puranam. She has lived in Teck Ghee more than 25 years. She sells Indian spices at the Block 409 market and her regular customers are her good friends.",2013
"So, we want to help Singaporeans own their homes, raise loving families and build strong communities. Therefore, I believe that home ownership is still a fundamental principle for Singapore. We can talk about rentals, we need some. We can talk about other models we may experiment, but the core of it, home ownership. 99-year lease, it is yours.",2013
"In the last two years we have moved decisively to do more to help Singaporeans to own their homes. We have built a record number of new flats, cleared the first-timer backlog. We have delinked new flat prices from the resale market and stabilised BTO prices. We have introduced a Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG), targeted for poorer households to buy two-room flats, three-room flats. We have raised the income ceilings and relieved the sandwiched class. And we have allowed singles to buy BTO flats, something which they have asked for, for a very long time. And we introduced the NS Recognition Award Ð NSRA Ð for NS men. It is a hongbao paid into the CPF accounts of the NSmen, which NSmen can use to buy a flat, some of it. So all of these things have made flats more affordable and more accessible.",2013
"But I know that Singaporeans still worry about property prices. We do surveys and it is one of the items on their minds, (along) with healthcare. They ask themselves - if they are young - can I afford a flat when I get married? If you are older - can my children afford to get married? Because no flat cannot get married, or as they say in Singapore, Ôcannot ROMÕ. They ask, what if I lose my job before I finish paying off my flat, paying off my housing loan? And so in the OSC conversations, Singaporeans wanted ÒHome First, Then AssetÓ. Ideally of course, you want the home, you want the asset, you want it all. One lady, a mother at a dialogue expressed this. She said she hoped her property would appreciate because it is hers and she wanted to keep its value, but then at the same time she wanted her kids to have cheaper housing. And then she laughed because she knew that you cannot really have both. You must decide which it is going to be. So we cannot deliver everything this mother is hoping for but we can maintain the value of HDB flats over the years, provided Singapore remains stable and strong. At the same time, we can keep the flats affordable for future flat buyers. And I will make sure that every Singaporean family who is working can afford an HDB flat. We can do that. What do I mean?",2013
"A family today, if you are earning $1,000, you should be able to afford a 2-room flat. If you are earning $2,000, you should be able to afford a 3-room flat. If you are earning $4,000, you should be able to afford a 4-room flat and that is completely possible. When I say afford, I mean use your CPF mostly and have a 25-year loan, not a 30-year loan and then in your later years, your income can be used to beef up your retirement savings. So $1K, 2-room flat; $2K, 3-room flat; $4K, 4-room flat; 25-year loan, mostly from your CPF. It can be done, we are almost there. How do we do this? I do not think we want to do this by bringing down the BTO prices because that after a while will bring down all the resale market and everybody who owns a flat in Singapore will be hurt. But we will keep the BTO prices stable for some time; we will increase the support for the lower and middle-income households. And we already have the mechanisms to do this, to subsidise flat purchases. I talked about the Special CPF Housing Grant just now, SHG. We also have the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) which extends to the middle income families as well, lower-middle-income households too. So together, low-income households and middle-income households get a big discount on 2-room flats and 3-room flats, sometimes more than one-third off the price in discounts.ÊBut we will do more.",2013
"For families who are only able to afford 2-room flats, I would say the 2-room flats are already quite affordable to them. We are happy they are able to buy the 2-room flats; it is a reasonable cost on them every month. But what we should do is to help them when they are ready to upgrade from a 2-room to a 3-room flat when they improve their lives, and we will give them some Step-Up Housing Grants to help them to upgrade later on. So from 2-room if you need to upgrade later, you get help from the Government. For others buying 3-room and 4-room flats, the lower income, the lower-middle income, first-time buyers, 3-room and 4-room flats, we can also do more. The 3-room flats relatively speaking are less of an issue, it is more affordable. The 4-room flats, it is okay but I think we can give more help to the households who are buying them. So we will extend the SHG, which is now only for 2- and 3-room flats, we will extend that also to 4-room. And we will also broaden it so that instead of only for the low income households, we will also allow it for the middle-income households. So what it means, net-net, is a middle-income household buying a 4-room flat can get a saving of up to $20,000, which is not so small. $20,000 more than what they are getting today which is already not so small.So let me explain how this works. I shall be your housing agent.",2013
"HDB has a very beautiful development - Fernvale Riverwalk, a BTO project in Sengkang. It is a marvellous place, waterfront living, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room flats, Sengkang West Avenue, Fernvale Link, Punggol Reservoir just down there. There are going to be four residential blocks, 20- to 22 storey-high with spaces for relaxation and bonding. So there will be childrenÕs playgrounds, if you are young kids; there will be adults and elderly fitness stations, you can practise for your IPPT; resting shelters, a precinct pavilion, open green spaces and if you like nature, not very far away, leisure stroll along the boardwalk next to Punggol Reservoir. Hence it is called Fernvale Riverwalk. Furthermore, supermarkets, eating house, shops and a childcare centre. Everything is there. How much do you think a 3-room flat in this place will cost, cheapest? People say flats are expensive. How much do you think they will cost? Think about it. BTO price, I think I should do a poll. I offer you three choices - $150,000, $200,000, $250,000. Who thinks that the cheapest flat is $250,000? Hands up. Who thinks the cheapest flat is $200,000? Hands up. Wow, quite a lot. Who thinks the cheapest flat is $150,000? I think we must vote again. $250,000 is out, so $150,000 and $200,000, your choice. $150,000, hands up. $200,000?. I think $200,000 wins, but actually $200,000 loses, because the cheapest flat is just $150,000. 3-room flats, posted price. So if you add grants, add subsidies, low income families pay even less. But people will say this is only because it is the cheapest flat. So let me take a typical flat in Fernvale Riverwalk, typical 3-room flat and let me show you some sums. I am still your HDB housing agent, remember, but not getting any commission from (Housing Minister) Khaw Boon Wan.",2013
"So a typical Fernvale 3-room flat BTO price, let me go through, show you the arithmetic because afterwards we got a stall outside, you can sign (up for a flat).Ê3-room BTO flat typical price is a bit more than $150,000 but not much more; it is $170,000. Now, let us assume that you are one of the (households with a monthly income of) $2,000 buying this flat. What grants are you going to get? Existing, just the present arrangements, you will have $45,000 of grants already, various things. But now because we have changed our SHG, you will get an extra $10,000 of grant and furthermore if the husband is an NS man, which I think most Singaporeans will be, from the NS Recognition Award, you will have another $4,000 worth of grant down there. So the nett price to him buying the flat, if you have your calculators, is $111,000. So when you think it is $200,000, I think that may be the impression, but it is not accurate. It is actually a lot more affordable than you think. If this household takes a 25-year mortgage, how much will the monthly repayment be? $427. So the CPF can pay all of that, cash repayment every month, zero. So it is not bad. It is so attractive that some people will now ask how about the 4-room flat. So let me show you the 4-room flat sums.",2013
"I take a typical flat again is $285,000. It is not the cheapest, the cheapest is about $250,000 odd, but I use a typical example. Household income for this family? Let us say $4,000. Husband and wife working, not hard to achieve. Existing grants for this household, they will already have $15,000 worth of grant but with a new scheme, with SHG extended, they will get $20,000 more. And I assume this is also an NS man, so $4,000 of NS Recognition Award going in towards the flat, so the net price to him is $246,000, less than a quarter million, also affordable. Now supposing they take a mortgage, 25-year mortgage, monthly repayment of $987, of which the CPF will look after $920 and his cash repayment, is all of $67 or about $2 a day.ÊNot bad. And people say HDB is making money. Something is wrong.",2013
"This is how we are making HDB flats more affordable and especially more affordable for the less well-off Singaporeans. Let me summarise my points. We have made significant moves in recent years. Tonight, what I have announced is another significant move but it is not the end of the story. We will monitor closely how well people can afford housing in Singapore and over time as it becomes necessary, we will do more to help the lower and the middle income Singaporeans own their homes. We will always make sure that an HDB flat is always within reach, affordable and available to Singaporeans. Do not worry, go ahead, plan on it, get married, get your flat. If you make the effort, the opportunities are there in Singapore.",2013
"Besides housing, we will also give Singaporeans more assurance over lifeÕs uncertainties, especially healthcare. Working adults feel the pressure taking care of growing children, also looking after elderly parents. People with chronic illnesses worry, worry about the cost of consultations, the cost of medicines, maybe a few cents a day but day after day, year after year. When you have high blood pressure, the doctor prescribes something to you. He says, please take this, please take this for the rest of your life and you have to take it seriously. Older people worry about the medical bills which they may face and worry about the burden which they may place on their children. So we will improve healthcare financing to give Singaporeans more peace of mind.",2013
"First of all, let me talk about outpatient care because that is a significant part of it and then let me say something about inpatient care which is actually a lesser problem but is a big worry to many Singaporeans. But first, outpatient care. One group which is concerned with outpatient care is those with chronic illnesses like Mr Tay Siew Mow, who is 59-years-old, has high blood pressure and regularly visits his GP for check-ups and medication. And as I said, high blood pressure, you have to take the pills for the rest of your life and the consultation and the pills price adds up. So how is he being helped? He is being helped through the CHAS scheme (Community Health Assist Scheme). He has a blue card. Every time he visits his doctor, he gets a subsidy up to $80, it helps pay for the consultation, helps pay for his medications. It is a big saving for him. He has a blue card, his wife has a blue card, his father, his sister, they all have their cards. But he has two teenage children, 15 and 17, and they do not have CHAS cards. Why? Because for CHAS, when we made the scheme, we set a lower limit, you have to be 40 years old before you can join the scheme to get it started. Now that the scheme is well launched, we have 300,000 people on CHAS, the system is working nicely, I think we remove this floor and younger Singaporeans will also be able to join the CHAS scheme, including Mr TayÕs two children. And I think that will diminish his worry about his familyÕs healthcare costs. So that is one aspect of outpatient treatment.",2013
"Another aspect of outpatient treatment is SOCs (Specialist Outpatient Clinics). When you go to the SOCs at SGH (Singapore General Hospital) or Tan Tock Seng, you get a subsidy. But for poor people, it may still add up to an expense. So we will increase the subsidies for the lower- and middle-income patients who are visiting Specialist Outpatient Clinics and we will means-test these additional subsidies so that we know we can target them to the people who need them. I think this is quite a big thing. Many people have expressed their concern to me over the SOC charges. This will make a difference to them.",2013
"The third big thing on outpatient treatment, but this is something which will take us some time to do, is Medisave. There are people, many people have asked for Medisave to be used for outpatient treatments. Most recently, Dr Lam Pin Min chaired the committee, the GPC and put up a report. He asked, can we use Medisave for outpatient treatments. I think they are right, we should do this. In principle, this is sound, it is personal responsibility. I save and I use the money when I get sick. If I did not save when I get sick, I must scramble for the cash, it is a problem. We want to move in this direction, we have already taken some steps there. You can use it for chemotherapy, you can use it for major outpatient operations but you go there, you do the operation, you come home. But I think you can extend it further and especially for old people, we can extend it further. We will be studying carefully how to do this. So thank you Pin Min for your suggestion.",2013
"So that is outpatient treatment. The other aspect of this inpatient treatment. If we should fall seriously ill, can I afford the hospital bill if I have a very big hospital bill? In reality, there are very few such cases. I wanted to look for a good example for tonight. I scanned all of my MPS cases over the last one year. I had 140 medical cases which in itself is already not a very big number, but none of the 140 medical cases had huge hospital bills. So I asked MOH, please find me a good example. MOH scanned their database. They also found very, very few examples. So in fact, if you are on MediShield, which most people are, you do not need to worry. Can I have a show of hands who is not on MediShield down here? Nobody, so you are alright. You should be alright but I know that even though I can explain this to you and you can understand what I am saying, people still worry. And some people do not have MediShield cover and they could have a problem because MediShield, it reaches 92 per cent of people but some of the older folks may not have it, some of the people who have pre-existing conditions may have fallen out, may not have it. And also there is another third group, the very old people, because MediShield stops at the age of 90. And there are quite a number of Singaporeans who are now more than 90 years old, including Mr Yasmuddin Rasul whom I showed you a picture of just now, he is 92, and of course Mr Ho Tee Soon who is 104. So, what will we do?",2013
"I think we revamp, relaunch MediShield, we give it a new name. We call it MediShield Life. Why MediShield Life? Because it will cover you for life. If you do not stop at 90, the Medishield Life will not stop at 90. So do not worry, it will cover old people. Secondly, MediShield Life will be universal. It will cover everybody, every Singaporean, old ones, young ones, those newly-born. Even those who are now outside the MediShield network, we will bring them back in. You may be elderly, you may have dropped out, you may have pre-existing illnesses, we will bring you back in. It may cost you a bit more but it can be done. There will be no more opting out from MediShield. Thirdly, MediShield Life will give you better protection for very large hospital bills. The patients will pay less out-of-pocket or out of their Medisave. I think the burden on the children, on the families will be less. So, three key things on MediShield Life. One, it is for life; two, it is universal for everybody; three, it gives you better cover for very big hospital bills. But because it does more, because the benefits are better, therefore, the MediShield LifeÕs premiums will have to be higher. It has to be, because it has to break even and I think for most people that will not be a problem. But for a few that could be a problem and for those who cannot afford, the Government will subsidise this MediShield Life premiums for them.",2013
"This is a very, very major step. We thought about it long and hard. We have argued it and we have decided we need to do it. But how exactly to design the scheme, I think we need to take some more time. And we need to consult and get views. So, we are going to do a public consultation, seek views before we decide on the details of the scheme and it will take a year, maybe more than that. But I think it is important that we try and get this started right because it is a very important step towards providing people protection and assurance that for medical care, you can be taken care of.",2013
"One group which we need to take special care of is our pioneer generation. They are special. They are the ones who worked hard to build todayÕs Singapore. The generation to independence: 60s, 70s, 80s. They made this place. They enabled us today to enjoy these facilities. They earned less than us. They had fewer safety nets when they were working. They brought up this generation and they paved the way for us to live a better life than themselves. That was their goal. They achieved it and I think we should know that and we should be grateful to them. Now mostly they are retired, at least in their late 60s, many older. And we must take special care of this pioneer generation in their golden years. We have recognised them and given them something extra. Every time we have had a bonus exercise, a scheme, Minister for Finance, each time we designed a scheme, we distribute something for the senior citizens, the pioneer generation, something extra. Whether it is home care subsidies, whether it is GST vouchers, whether it is a Resilience Package, we make sure that they are treated different. And I think in these new healthcare arrangements, we will likewise make sure that they are well taken care of. So, we will have a special Pioneer Generation Package to help pay for their premiums for this group under MediShield Life, to make sure that our pioneer generation will be well-covered and would not need to worry about healthcare in their old age.ÊI think we owe it to them.",2013
"What I have talked about on healthcare so far is what the Government is doing, but there is always that aspect which the individual must do. We each have to take personal responsibility for ourselves, both financing and also just looking after our health. We are going to spend more on healthcare year by year. The Government subsidies are going up and will go up some more. But some part of it has to be paid by ourselves and each of us must save enough to pay for our share. Therefore, I think you can guess what my next line will be - Medisave rates have to go up. It has to be. We will increase these contribution rates over time as and when our economic conditions permit. How, how much, we will have to discuss carefully. But the direction is quite clear, we need to save more and that will stand us in good stead because one day we will all grow old, if we are lucky. But the best way for us generally to keep healthcare costs down is to stay healthy and especially for older people because for older people exercise is not just keeping fit or keeping well but also making friends, having the social contacts, the networks, the mutual support.",2013
"Somebody who can keep an eye on you to say, are you all right? Something is not quite right with you, your walk has changed. You are not quite so steady, you are stuttering. Please see the doctor. And that is an important part of keeping old folks well. And I think the Wellness Programme, the Active Ageing Programme which Boon Heng has been pushing and is still pushing has been making a big difference in this. I met one group recently when I went to Jalan Besar. I went to Geylang West CC and there was a Cheerobics group there. This group of old people. What is Cheerobics? Cheerleading plus aerobics. Cheerleading is something which usually teenage young people do at football games, prancing around and throwing people up in the air. But old folks can do Cheerobics too. Let us see. (Cheerobics video plays.) Older than most of us but I think dancing and prancing around faster and better than most of us do.",2013
"The third major shift which we will make is to do more to keep paths upwards wide open to all.ÊKeeping paths wide open has been a fundamental principle for Singapore for a very long time. It is how we have enhanced our human potential. How we have created hope for every Singaporean and is especially true in education and that is why we have invested in pre-school, adding 20,000 places in the next five years as I said just now in Chinese. That is why we are going to contribute to Edusave accounts of every child between the age of 7 and 16, whether they are madrasah students, home-schoolers, overseas students, which I said in the Malay speech. These are signals that we value every child and that we want to give every person the best possible chance to start off well in life. Education is a big concern for parents and students because it plays a big role in shaping oneÕs potential and opportunities in Singapore.ÊParents know that, they want the best for their children. And therefore when it comes to key education milestones, these are high stress moments for the whole family, whether it is P1 admission, whether it is PSLE, the whole family gets involved.",2013
"There are two different perspectives on education, on schools in Singapore. One is the MOE perspective - Every School Is A Good School. Whichever school you go to, whichever class or principal you have, you will get a good education. And we give every school the teachers, the resources, the backing. We help many of our schools develop niches of excellence. We make sure that the whole system is of a high standard. Every school is a good school. But parents and students have a different perspective. They accept the MOE argument but they still have strong preferences for certain schools. And even within the same housing estate, two separate schools, few hundred metres apart, parents will go to great lengths to bring their children into School A instead of School B. I see it every year when it comes to school admission time after the PSLE exams, when people come and try very, very hard. Having got a place in a good school, they want a place in another school which in their view will be better for their kid. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they do not. But the belief is very deep. And nationally that happens too, because secondary schools admit students from across the country and based on their academic results. So, the results of parents looking for what they think are the best schools and consulting websites like kiasuparents.com -- I am past that point, but I have not reached kiasugrandparents.com yet -- but the result of that is certain top secondary schools get a very high concentration of the very good students or at least the students with very good results. So in these top secondary schools, standards are very high, competition to get in is very intense and everybody feels enormous pressure. So you have these two views, one, MOE - Every School is A Good School. Two, parents, I prefer School A to School B. You ask me what is my take; let me tell you my take.",2013
"I believe we can make every school a good school and we have done a lot of that to ensure that every school provides a good education for the students. We give them the resources, we give them the good teachers, we emphasise values and we have made a lot of progress towards this goal. I asked MOE for some examples. They gave me two examples, both from Bukit Batok. I think the MP will be pleased. The first one is Bukit View Primary School where children perform drama to develop their confidence and they put on performances. The second one is Hillgrove Secondary School where they do Flight and Aerospace Education and this thing which you see buzzing around (pointing to slide), this is one of the super light kites with propellers which sometimes come put on a show at National Day. So, every school is a good school and I push MOE very hard to give the schools the resources, the good principals, the flexibility, the authority to teach students according to their studentsÕ needs, to make the system work. And it is a philosophy which is not just for schools but even post-secondary levels. You look at this ITE campus Ð $500 million of investments, $500 million. Passionate lecturers, high quality programmes. Therefore, students are proud of themselves, wanting to be here, confident that beyond this, there are many possibilities in life.",2013
"So, we want every school to be good. But I am a realist. I accept that parents and students will always carefully choose which schools to go to. And I think it is good that parents compare and choose schools because it puts pressure on the schools to know that the parents are watching and that it makes a difference how they perform. But it is important that parents compare and contrast and choose on the right basis, not just examination grades but also how well the schools are really educating their children. Because you may have good grades because your children happen to be bright. But you may not be doing anything for them. They may be just educating themselves. You may have children who are not so naturally talented but with good education, you improve their performance, you make a big difference to them. So the quality of the schools, academically, in terms of character education, in terms of civic education, in terms of developing their studentsÕ interest - if the parents are comparing schools like that and choosing schools like that, then I think we have the right incentives and it will work.",2013
"What about top schools? I think it is also good that we have top schools nationally, schools which are acknowledged as outstanding, so long as we keep our system open. The system has to be open, meaning there cannot be barriers to entry. Outstanding students must always be able to make it to the top to get into these institutions and you cannot have a closed, self-perpetuating elite - I am here, my children are here, you are not in this magic circle, you cannot come in. Some societies become like that. We must never become like that. We must have many pathways in our system, an open system so students can come in. If they do not fit, they go out. If later on, they develop, they could come in. There are many other points when they can come in depending on their performance and depending on their ability. If you have this, we have a high base, we have peaks and you have a landscape with many peaks of excellence and there is pressure on raising standards across the board. We give good education to all our children. We can uplift the whole education system. If we have a completely flat and featureless system Ð every school is exactly the same as every other school, no difference Ð you will have not excellence, but mediocrity. In the old days in China they used to have that. You would be so and so city, School No. 37, and the next one is School No. 38, and what is the difference? Just the number, everything else is the same. Nobody makes the effort. Today in China they have a very complicated landscape. They have experimental schools, they have elite institutions. It is a socialist society, but the schools compete. Our schools we make sure all of them are good but all of them have to keep on competing to be good.Ê",2013
"We have an excellent education system. But our society is getting more stratified. Competition is intensifying amongst our students and the focus, unfortunately I think, is too much on examination performance and not enough on learning. It is very hard to fight these forces because parents want the best for their children and they think the examination results are what makes the difference. But I think we need to recalibrate to keep our system open and to focus on things which matter more than exam grades in the long run. But the education system is a very complicated and delicate machinery. You can say what you like or do not like about it; you cannot just push it and expect it to become better. You must find the right spot, fine tune, make the precise adjustment and then watch carefully to see whether it has become better. So, I am proposing to make four small adjustments which I will tell you about tonight - starting at P1 admissions.",2013
"P1 admissions is a complicated process. You have got Phase One, Phase Two, 2A, 2B, 2C and so forth. And it gives priority to siblings, to children of alumni, to the school community - for a reason. Because we want each school to develop its traditions, its history, and its identity. We want the school to have a community which cares for it. We want the school to be proud of itself, to have to know where it has come from and to feel that. When I wear the uniform, there is a history behind this. I come from Nanyang - Nanyang and Hwa Chong go back a long way. I come from Catholic High - that means something. And likewise with so many other schools and I think we want to preserve this. But at the same time we do not want our primary schools to be closed institutions and you can only get in if your parents have been there. In the past, even popular primary schools usually would have places available for children who did not have any connection with the school. But over time, the number of places for these unconnected children have shrunk and you can see in this yearÕs P1 registration exercise, quite a number of schools have had to ballot earlier in the process which means for the later phases there are already no more places left. And if we do nothing, one day these schools may have no places left at all for those who have no connections, which I think will be bad. So we have got to strike a balance. The alumni would prefer us to keep the system. The public? They have different views. OSC discussed this; the participants proposed solutions. One says, give absolute priority to those who are living nearby, which is fine if you happen to be living nearby the school you want to go to, or if you can afford to buy a house nearby the school you want to go to, but it is not such an ideal system if you take it from a system point of view. Somebody else said do away with all these priorities, flatten it out, 100 per cent balloting. Just have racial quotas to make sure every school is mixed. 100 per cent balloting. We will be back to the school number 37, 38 or 99 and I suppose you will wear school uniforms where you put the number on them.",2013
"I do not think these extreme solutions will work and anyway, whatever solution you make, parents will find ingenious ways to maximise their chances. For example, one mother moved house four times to give her older children a better chance to get into the primary schools. In Chinese they say meng mu san qian (____). This one outdoes that. Meng mu san qian refers to Meng ZhiÕs mother who moved home three times because her neighbours were unsuitable, so they finally moved to a place where her neighbours were suitable and Meng Zhi could grow up properly. Here, the neighbours were perfectly suitable, the mother was looking for a place to get into the right school. Four times! Outdoes Meng ZhiÕs mother. Some couples split up, two of them holding handphones with instant communication. You go to school A and I go to school B. They update each other in real time - is it balloting, how many, what are the chances, where shall I put my name in? It becomes a military operation.",2013
"So I think we need to strike a better balance.ÊFrom next year, every primary school will set aside 40 places, at least, for children who have no prior connection with the school in Primary One. And we will give every Singaporean child a chance to enter the primary school of his choice. It does not mean we will be able to accommodate everybody, there may be a scramble and you will have to ballot for these 40 places, but at least the school will be open and it will never become completely closed. But at the same time, we are continuing to upgrade the quality of every primary school and MOE has asked me to say this again and I say it with conviction. We are doing this. You can take it on faith from me that I am going to invest in all of the schools and whichever school your child gets into, we are going to try to do our very best for him or her.",2013
"The second small thing we are going to do is something about the PSLE, the scoring system. The PSLE is one of our most important examinations or at least, many parents think that the PSLE is one of our most important examinations. Because it is not just a report of the studentÕs performance in primary school, but parents think that this determines the studentÕs future. I just had an email from somebody who wrote to me to say, please be very careful when you touch the PSLE, because the problem is not the exam. The problem is that parents think that the exams count for everything in the world. If you go to this stream, you are fixed for life; you go to that stream, you are fixed for life; if you go there, well, you are set for life. So that is the problem. So I replied to him, I said no, I do not agree that that (i.e. the stream determining oneÕs path for life) is the how our education system works but I shall be very careful. He replied to me again, he says, I do not agree that is how the education works either but that is how parents think and therefore, we have to be cognisant of that and we have to take that into account and I think we must do that. But whatever it is, because of all this, because of the way the parents think, there is a tremendous stress when it comes to the PSLE exam.ÊThe whole family takes the examination! I knew that people went on leave for PSLE but I watched a snippet on Mediacorp recently, and this mother said she actually stopped work for the whole year to take the PSLE with her daughter! What do we do? I asked, what did the OSC people say? One group went into this, came back and reported, we discussed this at length, we do not like the existing system at all, we looked at all sorts of alternatives, we could not agree on an alternative which was a better way to post the students to secondary schools. So the recommendation finally - please do not change the PSLE system. But I think we should make some careful changes to the PSLE system.",2013
"Just to put this in perspective - the PSLE, everybody thinks it matters, heaven and earth. But I do not know what my PSLE grade is. I think many of you who are my age do not know what your PSLE grade is either because when I took the PSLE nearly 50 years ago, in fact, 50 years ago in 1963 already, the scores were confidential. MOE never told anybody the scores. The students were only told whether they had passed or they had failed and which school they had been posted to. So we were all gathered in the car park in Nanyang waiting anxiously while the teachers went through the list and tallied up who passed, who failed and then came out after a very long wait and told us who passed, who failed. Luckily, I passed!",2013
"But today, it is different. Today, everybody knows his T-score. Not just everybody knows his T-score, everybody knows his friendsÕ T-score and his friendsÕ sons or daughtersÕ T-score. When they meet they compare notes, saying Òhow much did your daughter get? Wah, 230, not bad, can get into this school or not? And what about him, did you hear that one went to 180? Wah, do not know what happenedÓ. It happens, so I do not think it is a good thing. One-point difference in the PSLE scores, 230 versus 231, may make all the difference in your secondary school posting. But at the age of 12, one examination, four papers and you want to measure the child to so many decimal points and say well, this one got one point better than that child? It is a distinction which is meaningless and too fine to make. Who is going to grow up abler, more committed, more capable, a better contributor to society? At the age of 12, you can guess, you cannot tell. Certainly, you cannot tell based on one point difference and I do not think we should decide secondary school postings based on such fine distinctions.",2013
"So we will score PSLE differently. We will use wider bands for grades, ÔOÕ levels are like that, ÔAÕ levels are like that. ÔOÕ levels, you have A1 all the way down to 9 which is a fail. ÔAÕ levels, I am not sure how exactly, but you also have A, B, C, D, E but I think if we have a system of grades like that rather than precise scores, it will reduce the excessive competition to chase that last point. If you get an A* that is an A*, it does not matter where it is 91 A* or 99 A*. It is an A* and that is good enough. You do not have to chase that last point. Then you will be able to sit back and you have space to educate and develop the students more holistically. But what I am talking about is what we are intending to do. It will take us some time, several years. So if you are taking the PSLE in a few monthsÕ time or if your son or your grandson is taking PSLE in a few monthsÕ time, please do not panic. We are not going to do anything this year. It is going to take several years to do.",2013
"Next, let me say something about having more flexibility in secondary schools. We want secondary schools to have the flexibility to tailor the education of their students to their abilities and the development of their students. Some develop faster than others, some have interest in certain subjects more than others, some are good at all subjects, a few are weak at many subjects. We have to have a system which can fit each of these cases and we will adapt it to that person. Already we have some flexibility between points, between PSLE to ÔNÕ levels, or ÔOÕ levels to ÔAÕ levels. You can cross over; you are not fixed in one stream or one course. And we have students who have made this and transferred.ÊFor example, I have two young people here who have made this. I have Lim Chi Siang, who is here with us this evening. He went from EM3; he went to Normal (Academic) stream in Si Ling Secondary School. He went on to Yishun JC and after JC, he has made it to NUS to study Physics. He is now doing NS but after NS, NUS is there, the place is available to him. So the system has given him the chance, the time to develop, make sure he learns properly, next stage take a bit longer, five years rather than four in ÔNÕ levels, then JC he made good, now he is going to university. Or another example, Ahmad Muhammad bin Rosman, who had a difficult family background. He went from EM3 to Normal (Tech). Many people do not prefer Normal (Tech). From Normal (Tech) he went to ITE. ITE did a good job with him. He did well, he skipped the Higher NITEC course, he has entered Singapore Poly and he is doing a Diploma in Visual Effects and Motion Graphics. So one day, he will help me make graphics for my presentation.",2013
"So we want more people to be like them and we will create more flexible choices in secondary schools. And we will do this progressively.ÊWhat we will do is allow Secondary One students, whichever stream you are in, you can take a subject at a higher level if you have done well in that subject in PSLE. So you may be in Normal (Academic) but if you have done well in Maths, you can do that subject at ÔOÕ levels when you go to secondary school. You may be in Normal (Tech), you are good in languages, you can take languages at ÔNÕ level or at ÔOÕ level when you are in secondary school. You will have that flexibility so that you can learn each subject at a pace appropriate to you, you can build on your strengths and build up your confidence, your pride and then you can go further and fulfil your potential. I think this is a step, one step in the direction to making our system more open, more flexible.ÊGo ahead (and clap). Not to cheer me, cheer the students who will now have the chances to move ahead. They deserve it.",2013
"Finally, let me say something about the top schools. This is a somewhat awkward subject. We want every school to be a good school. Why are there top schools in Singapore? I think there are top schools in Singapore; it is good that we have these outstanding schools in our system with very high standards. It is a tribute to the teachers, the students and also to our education system. Many of these schools have long history and traditions, some even longer than SingaporeÕs. Over time, they have produced many leaders Ð leaders in the private sector, leaders in the social services and leaders in the government. They have produced not just successful people but pillars of our society. Not the only way to do so but a significant number of people have done so. Therefore, it is all the more critical that these schools should develop their students holistically and admit their students holistically and imbue the right ethos and values to them, expose them to diverse backgrounds, to build empathy and understanding and make sure the students stay rooted in the society which has nurtured them and invested hopes in them. Most importantly, we need to keep the admissions to the top schools open, so they do not also become closed circles. Not closed because you have to have certain parents, but closed because you have to have perfect grades. So I think that you should take not just students with outstanding academic results, but also very good students with other special qualities - qualities of character, of resilience, of drive, leadership - people who can show that they can make a difference in the world. And the top schools also must make sure that students from low-income backgrounds are not put off from applying to enter for fear that they cannot afford it, or that they cannot fit in because sometimes you can afford it, but if you do not feel comfortable because you feel like your friends are talking about things which you cannot afford, you feel out of place and I think that is bad and should not happen. So we must do something more to keep this spirit of openness and to enhance this diversity of opportunity for admission into the top schools.",2013
"What will we do? Two major things. One, the top schools, in fact all schools, have a DSA programme, a Direct School Admissions programme.ÊWe will broaden the DSA categories. Now if you are outstanding in arts, in sports, even in academics, you can come in on the DSA. But we must broaden this to also take into account character, resilience, drive, leadership. We have got to get the top schools to actively seek out such students, look for them. Some of them have scholarships for these schemes. We have got to get and invite primary schools to suggest possible students to the schools or suggest to the students that they take an interest (in their secondary school postings), explore it. You do not have to go there, it is not the only way up, but if you are thinking of going there, you do not have to worry. The opportunity is there, the door is open. So one, I think we should make a big effort in this to try and bring in people with the attributes we are looking for. But secondly, I think we can do more to enhance financial assistance and bursary schemes for these schools. We have the schemes; we should enhance them substantially so that anybody who qualifies and wants to attend these top secondary schools can confidently do so. And that way we can make sure that our top schools stay open, produce graduates who become assets to our society and are connected to Singapore and to our whole community which they belong to.ÊI think that is the right way forward for us to go.",2013
"So these changes to our education system will help to keep our pathways upwards open to all and make meritocracy work better for Singapore. Meritocracy has to remain the most fundamental organising principle in our society. We have to recognise people for their contributions and their effort, not for their backgrounds, not for their status or wealth or connections. This cannot be a society which is based on guan xi (connections). It must be based on your ability, your contributions, what are you giving back to the society. So at the same time, if you succeed under our system, then you must feel the duty to contribute back because you did not do it alone. Therefore, if that works, we invest in you, you give back, then everyone will benefit from the system and will see it as fair and good.ÊESM Goh recently went down to RI for an alumni dinner and he described this as building a Òcompassionate meritocracyÓ and I think he was exactly on the point. One good example of this in action is Dr Yeo Sze Ling. She is here with us this evening. I met her and I thought I should tell you about her. Dr Yeo Sze Ling became blind at the age of four. She studied at the Singapore School for the Visually Handicapped. She did not go to a brand name school. She went to Bedok South Secondary School, Serangoon JC. She had an interest in Mathematics, she was good at it, she read Mathematics in NUS and she graduated with three degrees, including a PhD in Math. I stare at a page of Math with the formulas; I do not understand what is going on sometimes. But to be able to imagine it, visualise it, manipulate it, express it, that is amazing. She topped the Faculty of Science in her year, now she is a research scientist at A*STAR and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at NTU. (Pointing to slide) And here you see her, she is operating a Braille typewriter with headphones and so the headphones read back presumably the mathematical formula which she is typing in. But she is not just a successful professional, she is volunteering at the Society for the Physically Disabled, helping others to overcome their disabilities, which is why she richly deserved to win the Singapore Youth Award last year where I met her. Well done, Sze Ling! Sze Ling proves that you can do well if you work hard. It does not matter what your circumstances are and that is what we have to try to do to contribute back to the society and keep the system fair for all.",2013
"I have described how the Government will do more in this new balance but for this new balance to work, we all have a part to play. The Government can provide a flat but it is up to us to make a home. The Government can make healthcare more affordable but it is up to us to take care of ourselves and one another. The Government can make our education system more open but it is up to us to seize the opportunities and realise our potential. The community will also have to do more to complement the individual efforts and the GovernmentÕs programmes.ÊAnd the community is alive and well in Singapore. We saw it during the recent haze. We had young people like Sylvester Yeo who donated his own money to provide N95 masks for elderly cleaners and hawkers. We had taxi drivers who bought and distributed masks to one another so that taxis could continue to operate. We had grassroots efforts to deal with day-to-day issues. I came across one example recently in Siglap, Loyang Villas which is a private estate where Dr Maliki, who is the MP, worked with them to solve a problem. They had a problem of indiscriminate parking, which I think many private estates have. So they had a dialogue, Dr Maliki encouraged them to come together and work out a solution among themselves. So the residents set up a taskforce to study the problem and discuss what could be done. The taskforce produced a ÒCode of Conduct for Responsible ParkingÓ. (Reading Code of Conduct) Code of conduct, item number two - we should park at least one vehicle within our porch or driveway. Makes sense, right? Item number three - we should not place objects to ÒchopeÓ (reserve) parking spaces, so hence you see the dustbins down there, I presume now removed. They saved on parking aunties and maybe the other estates can learn something from them.",2013
"But I am particularly cheered that many young people are doing good work. For example, I showed you some pictures earlier of my residents - Mr and Mrs Lim, Mr Ho Tee Soon who is 104, Mdm Puranam who is selling spices at my market. How did I get those pictures? They were a PAYM project in my CC. The PAYM mobilised themselves, they went around, interviewed residents, learnt their stories, took pictures of them, put up an exhibition in Teck Ghee CC. (Ms Khoo) Hanzhi was the photographer. I saw the exhibition and decided this is what I am going to use for my National Day Rally. Thank you very much, Hanzhi!",2013
"Other students are more ambitious. They go overseas to do good work. Singapore Poly did a Project NEPAL (Never Ending Passion and Love). They went to Nepal and they did a project building classrooms for the children there. You can see it is hot and dusty but it is a good experience for them. So we want to encourage more young people to build a better world and a better Singapore. You are our future. You are idealistic, full of energy and passion. Go forth, change Singapore, change the world, for the better.",2013
"To help you do that, we will set up a youth volunteer corps. We will expand opportunities for young people to do projects in our community, especially students in our post-secondary institutions - the ITEs, the polys and universities. The youth corps will provide resources to support you, funding to start your own projects, allowances to take say a term off for full-time community service. Grants, so after graduation you can continue serving the community. It will offer mentors to guide you, advise you, make the most of your efforts, match you with critical community needs, help you to make a difference to our nation.",2013
"These new policiesÊÐ housing, healthcare and education Ð are very significant shifts. They are part of ÒOur New Way ForwardÓ. But our ultimate destination and core purpose have not changed. We want to ensure that every Singaporean shares in the nationÕs progress. We want to support the less fortunate and the vulnerable. We want to create opportunities for Singaporeans to do your best and ultimately, to build a stronger Singapore. It is going to take some time to work out the policies and programmes and to realise this new balance between the state, the community and the individual. It is going to take still more time to show results and we will assess how our strategies, our policies and programmes turn out and then as we gain experience and as our needs evolve, we will take further steps carefully forward. We are not taking these steps because our system is bad. On the contrary, we are starting from a strong position. Whether it is housing, whether it is healthcare, whether it is education, whatever our qualms, whatever our grumbles, whatever we may gripe about sometime, it is not perfect but by international standards they are all excellent and that is a fact.",2013
"Even transport, which worries many Singaporeans, we are making progress with new buses, with new train lines, with new free early morning MRT rides into the city. Even our baseline by international comparisons, honestly speaking, is not bad. And I am glad that some people appreciate our transport system like this couple, Mr and Mrs Wesley Lim. They did not just pose in front of the railway carriage. Instead of a wedding limo, the MRT got them to the church on time. And as Wesley said, ÒThe ride of our lives. Who needs an S-Class when you can have an $8 billion Circle Line?Ó So I encourage more of you to do that.",2013
"Our new strategic direction will take us down a different road from the one that has brought us here so far. There is no turning back. I believe this is the right thing to do given the changes in Singapore, given the major shifts in the world. We proceed but let me sound a word of caution: All this is not without risk.",2013
"Other countries have tried to do similar things in the past with the best intentions but ended up with unwanted outcomes. America has the highest healthcare spending in the world. Their outcomes are worse than many developed countries, including Singapore. Finland has comprehensive protections for workers, yet 20 per cent of its youth is unemployed despite a good economy and a good education system. It could happen to us. Therefore, we have to tread carefully, beware the pitfalls. We will do more for the low income but we cannot undermine self-reliance. We will increase healthcare spending but we cannot encourage over consumption and unnecessary treatments. We will make the education system broader and more open but we cannot compromise academic standards and rigour.",2013
"And finally of course, all good things have to be paid for. For now we can afford these measures from existing revenues. In the longer term, their costs will rise, especially healthcare costs. MediShield Life and additional subsidies. Over time the amount will grow year-by-year. Today, people accuse us Òwhy are we spending so little on healthcare?Ó One day we will be lamenting Òwhy are we spending so much, how do we save?Ó. The risks are there. We have to realise this, we have to be prepared to pay for this, whether by raising taxes, whether by cutting back on other spending, if we want to keep the social safety nets and the programmes. We cannot saddle our childrenÕs generation with debt so as to pay for our consumption. And I think Singaporeans know this. When I posted onto my Facebook page what I was going to talk about at the National Day Rally, one reader Ð Julie Chin - commented on my Wall and she spoke absolute sense. She said: ÒI just hope any changes are not populist ones that aim to appease the angry, entitled populace and put the burden on our kids and grandkids in the future. I would rather I have it tougher now just so my kids will not have a heavier burden to carry later.Ó And I think she spoke absolute sense. We are here now because our parents had it tougher and built this for us. For us to say let us be comfortable and let our kids take care of themselves, I think that is irresponsible.",2013
"We must pass on to our children a better Singapore than the one we inherited. We owe it to them to do so. Just as we owe what we have today to our founding generation. Dr Goh Keng Swee, another of our founding fathers once said, ÒWe must not think of where we are as the pinnacle of achievement, but as a base from which to scale new heights.Ó And I am glad that our young people are up to this challenge. On National Day last week, I opened the newspaper or rather I looked at it on my iPad, and I was greatly cheered to read a Forum letter from a young lady, 15-year-old student, Ms Cheang Ko Lyn. And she said ÒSingapore is not perfect and there may be flaws. But if we do not fight to protect and build it, no one else will. It is precisely because Singapore is not perfect that my generation must remain here, working to further improve it. We are all still learning, so have a little faith in our country.Ó And she quoted Mr Lee Kuan Yew what he said back in 1967: ÒThere is tranquillity, poise and confidence in Singapore. And it is a confidence born out of the knowledge that there were very few problems which we cannot overcome.Ó And then she ended by saying, ÒLet us not be the generation which forgets that.Ó I think it made my day and if our young people feel this way then I think it is our responsibility and my responsibility to make sure that in fact they are able to fulfil their dreams. As the OSC participants said, to build a Singapore with Opportunities, with Purpose, with Assurance, with Community Spirit and Trust. A home where we celebrate many talents like Anthony Chen, whose ÒIlo IloÓ film won the Cannes Camera dÕOr for Best First Film. Or the LionsXII, who won the Malaysian Super League after 19 long years. Above all, a society where the human spirit flourishes.",2013
"To realise these dreams, we need to do the tangible things too - to build our city, to improve our living environment, to prosper our economy. And we are doing so all over Singapore. Punggol Waterway, a beautiful river for residents in Punggol and all over Singapore - not far from Fernvale Riverwalk. Jurong Lake District, an integrated town with homes, offices and leisure by the lake. The Sports Hub opening next April, a beautiful new stadium to watch sports. Also many facilities to play sports, whether as a professional athlete or weekend warrior. And maybe one day I can hold my NDR there too!",2013
"These are things already happening but beyond that, we have to plan and dream and build for the very long term. Take for example, Changi Airport. What is Changi Airport? To travellers - an icon of Singapore. To Singaporeans - a welcome landmark telling us that we have arrived home. To me it is a part of the Singapore identity - a symbol of renewal and change. I was one of the first passengers to use Changi Airport in 1981. In fact I took off on a test flight before the airport opened Ð I was a guinea pig to help test the airport systems. MINDEF chartered a flight to some secret place for training and we took off in the middle of the night, went through immigration, customs, searched and they picked up my knife in my hand luggage. Fortunately it was an experiment and, I kept my knife. But they (the customs officers) were on duty, it worked. We arrived home a few weeks later at Changi Airport. Paya Lebar had moved to Changi. Changi was in full business. We found Changi a vast improvement compared to the old Paya Lebar Airport. The control tower was especially beautiful.",2013
"But Changi Airport is more than an emotional symbol. It is how the world comes to Singapore and how Singaporeans connect with the world. It is why we thrive as an international hub for business, for trade, for tourism. The airport and all the things which are connected with the airport, all the related services, they provide a lot of jobs in Singapore. I would not ask you to guess how many. But it is 163,000 jobs in Singapore, 6 per cent of the GDP and it is all levels of society. When air travel goes down during SARS, during a recession, taxi drivers feel it immediately. Especially the taxi drivers living in Tampines and Pasir Ris nearby, business is down, the queue at the airport of taxis becomes longer. But the airport is also the reason for our vibrant aerospace industry and the popularity of our aerospace courses in schools. For example, here in ITE College Central, we have an Aerospace Engineering course. In fact there is a Boeing 737 outside. A real aeroplane here to train our students, avionics, airframe, mechanics, engines. I posted this picture (referring to slide) on Facebook. Somebody asked, is that (Boeing 737) real or is that photoshopped? I said it is real. It is here because we are the hub, because we have Changi Airport. And we have Changi Airport today because in the 1970s, forty years ago, Mr Lee Kuan Yew had the vision to imagine the old RAF Changi Airbase becoming an international airport to replace Paya Lebar and he pushed for it against the advice of experts who recommended expanding Paya Lebar, building a second runway in Paya Lebar. Can you imagine? One runway in Paya Lebar, already aeroplanes coming in and going out over so many houses. (What more) two runways in Paya Lebar? But Mr Lee said no, study, study, study again. Got Howe Yoon Choon to lead it who pushed it and made it happened. And I think we owe it to them and we are grateful to them.",2013
"So we inherited this butÊwe have also progressively expanded and upgraded Changi over the years. Now three terminals, handling 51 million passengers last year. Can still grow some, but approaching its limits and the business is growing. Passenger traffic is up. All over Asia, middle-classes are travelling, air travel is booming. People are going on holiday, doing business. Singaporeans are travelling all over the world. National Day weekend, how many of you were not in Singapore? I was recently on holiday in Japan, went to Mt Fuji. I met more Singaporeans on Mt Fuji than Japanese. Other airports in Southeast Asia are expanding to take advantage of these opportunities. KLIA, they are planning to service 100 million passengers per year. Bangkok Suvarnabhumi (Airport) also aiming for 100 million passengers a year and both of them are geographically better-placed than Singapore to be the hub in Southeast Asia. Because from Europe to Southeast Asia to the Far East whether it is Hongkong or Japan or China, KL is nearer, Bangkok is nearer still. But we are the hub. Why? Because they are not Changi Airport! That makes a difference.",2013
"Now the question is: Do we want to stay this vibrant hub of Southeast Asia or do we want to let somebody take over our position, our business and our jobs? That is our choice. Do we want to let somebody else eat our cheese? And I think we must be part of this growth and we have to plan ahead and continually build up Changi. And we have plans to do so. (Talks through video) Today, in Changi we already have T1, T2 and T3. They are there but we will keep on upgrading them. We are building a new terminal. There was a budget terminal. They said they are rebuilding a budget terminal, next thing I knew it became a T4. I told them it does not look like a budget (terminal) anymore. But the business is there. It will be good and we have one more trick outside T1, we will build something special. There is a carpark there, open air car park there, since the beginning. It should not still be there. We are going to replace with what we have codenamed ÒProject JewelÓ. ÒProject JewelÓ looks like this. We will expand T1, so T1 will be connected with it as will the others. But it will have shops, restaurants and a beautiful indoor garden. So we have Gardens by the Bay, this one is Gardens at the Airport. Not just for visitors but for Singaporeans too Ð families on Sunday outings, students maybe studying for exams, newly-weds taking bridal photos.",2013
"For the longer term, we are already planning T5. T5 sounds like a terminal but actually it is a whole airport by itself, as big as todayÕs Changi Airport but connected together so it all operates as one. Two runways, third runway, new T5, doubling the capacity. Starting work now, target date, mid-2020s Ð12, 15 years time. And this is how we can stay the hub in Southeast Asia and create many more opportunities for Singaporeans. But this is just one phase. Beyond this we have further bold plans because we are going to build a new RSAF airbase and a new runway at Changi - Changi East Airbase. And why are we doing that because if we do that, we can move Paya Lebar Airbase to Changi East and free up Paya Lebar Airbase. You look at this area, it is 800 hectares. It is bigger than Ang Mo Kio, it is bigger than Bishan. But it moves out, we will build new homes, new offices, new factories, new parks, new living environments, new communities. But in fact, it is not just these 800 ha. Because if you move the airbase, you remove the height restrictions on a big area around the airbase which are now constrained because you have to take off, you have to land, you have to provide safety and that frees us to develop new exciting plans for the big chunk of eastern Singapore, going all the way down to Marina and Marina South. So you are talking about 2030 and beyond, and it would not fully happen for maybe 20, 30 years after that because houses are built, houses do not need to be pulled down overnight. But the potential is there. We can dream.",2013
"Besides Paya Lebar, we also have plans for our port in Tanjong Pagar. Tanjong Pagar, with Brani, with Keppel, with Pasir Panjang, is one of the busiest ports in the world. Business is good. The port has been very successful. It is growing, it is reaching its limits. So we are building a new port in Tuas, bigger, more efficient, almost double the present capacity. And then we can stay the hub port and make sure the business stays here. And when this is done, we can move from Tanjong Pagar to Tuas. Starting 2027 when the portsÕ leases expire and when they move to Tuas, you will free up the prime land in Tanjong Pagar. And there we can build a Southern Waterfront City. This is a satellite picture, so you can see it all on one screen. But it is a huge area. It 1,000 ha, or 2.5 times the size of Marina Bay, all the way from Shenton Way to Pasir Panjang, from the east all the way to the west.",2013
"These are very ambitious, long-term plans. It is an example of how we need to think and plan for our future. And it reflects our fundamental mindset and spirit Ð to be confident, to look ahead, to aim high. If we can carry off these plans, we do not have to worry about running out of space or possibilities for Singapore. We are not at the limit, the sky is the limit! We are creating possibilities for the future. We are opening up opportunities for our children, for their children to continue to build, to upgrade, to reinvent the city for many more years to come.",2013
"Very few countries or cities anywhere in the world can think or plan over such a long term. But Singapore has been able to do it. This is how we got here and this is what we must do to be here tomorrow, next year and for many years to come. But in a deeper sense, these are not plans. These are acts of faith in Singapore and in ourselves. Faith that a generation from now Singapore will still be here, and will still be worth investing in, for the sake of our grandchildren and their grandchildren. Faith that we can thrive in the world, whatever the challenges, and hold our own against the competition, bigger, stronger, but we are there. Faith that we can get our politics right, that we can throw up honest, capable, trusted people to lead our country well, to make our system work for Singaporeans. Faith that we can stay together as one united people, maintain a steady course year after year and make our dreams come true. Nowhere was this faith more vividly expressed than in our National Day Parade. When we sang Majulah Singapura together as the flag flew past on a helicopter. When we Òpledge ourselves as one united peopleÉ to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nationÓ. This yearÕs Parade showed what Singapore can do. In the stories of our fellow Singaporeans, especially those who have overcome adversity, like our wheelchair basketballers. In the faces of the participants, radiant and happy, thrilled to be part of this shared story. In the response of the crowds, crowds at the Floating Platform, crowds around Marina Bay, crowds before TV screens and monitors all over Singapore in fact around the world. Watching them, feeling them, made me and my colleagues more determined to do the best for Singaporeans. They bolstered our conviction that it is worth doing and we can do it.",2013
"We may have made major shifts in our policies, but our core purpose has not changed. To create opportunities for Singaporeans, to fulfil their potential, do their best, to invest in every Singaporean and develop their innate talent, to keep Singapore a place where the human spirit thrives. We are not done building Singapore, we never will. Work with each other, work with us. Together, let us forge our new way forward. Together, let us build a better Singapore for all of us.",2013
